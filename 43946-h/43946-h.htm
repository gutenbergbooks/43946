<h2 title="Preface"><a id="preface"></a>PREFACE</h2>

<p>This volume is designed to be an aid to the amateur collector
and student of the organisms, both animal and vegetable,
which are found upon North American beaches. In it are
described many invertebrates and some of the more notable varieties
of seaweeds, and each individual is given its proper place in
the latest classification.</p>

<p>The technicality of classification or scientific grouping may
at first seem repellent, but it in reality makes the study of these
objects more simple; and a systematic arrangement has been
adopted in the belief that it is the easiest as well as the only satisfactory
way of becoming familiar with the organisms described.
Without it a very confused picture of separate individuals would
be presented to the mind, and a book like the present one would
become a mere collection of isolated scraps of information. Morphology,
or the study of structure, has been touched upon just
enough to show the objects from the biologist's point of view and
to enable the observer to go a little beyond the bare learning of
names.</p>

<p>Scientific names have been used from necessity, for the plants
and animals of the beach are so infrequently observed, except by
scientific people, that but few of them have common names;
and, as a matter of fact, the reader will find that a scientific name
is as easily remembered as a common one. Technical phraseology
has, however, been avoided as much as possible, even at the
expense of conciseness and precision; where it has been used, care
has been taken to explain the terms so that their meaning will be
plain to every one. A general glossary has been omitted, but the
technical terms used have been indexed. The illustrations will
bear the use of a hand-glass, and this will often bring out details
which cannot well be seen by the unaided eye.</p>

<p>The systematic table of the marine algæ, as given in Part I,
and followed in the text, will be of use to collectors who wish to
make herbaria. In order to name and group specimens such a
guide is necessary. Should specific names lead to embarrassment,
many of them can be neglected, for the names of genera are often
a sufficient distinction.</p>

<p>Since so many species of invertebrates are found on the beach
that a complete enumeration of them is impracticable, only the
most conspicuous ones have been selected for description in
Part II; but the attempt has been made to designate the various
classes and orders with sufficient clearness to enable the collector
to identify the objects commonly found on the shore, and to
follow the subject further, if he so desires, in technical books.</p>

<p>It is hoped that this book will suggest a new interest and
pleasure to many, that it will encourage the pastime of collecting
and classifying, and that it will serve as a practical guide to a better
acquaintance with this branch of natural history, without necessitating
serious study. Marine organisms are interesting acquaintances
when once introduced, and the real purpose of the
author is to present, to the latent naturalist, friends whom he will
enjoy.</p>

<p>Grateful acknowledgment is here made to the following persons
who have kindly assisted and advised the author and have
also extended valued courtesies to her in the preparation of

Historical Society of Brooklyn for the use of its fine herbarium,
containing the collections of Mr. John Hooper, Mr. A. R. Young,
and others, from which most of the illustrations of algæ in this
book were photographed; Miss Toedtleberg, Librarian of the Long
Island Historical Society; Miss Ingalls, in charge of the Museum
of the Long Island Historical Society; Dr. Theodore Gill; James

 I<br />SIGNS ON THE BEACH</h3>
</div>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The sea-shore, with its stretches of sandy beach and rocks,
seems, at first sight, nothing but a barren and uninteresting
waste, merely the natural barrier of the ocean. But to the observant
eye these apparently desolate reaches are not only teeming
with life; they are also replete with suggestions of the past.
They are the pages of a history full of fascination for one who
has learned to read it.</p>

<p>In this history even the grains of sand have a part. Though
so humble now, they once formed the rocky barriers of the shore.
They stood as do the rocks of to-day, defiant and seemingly everlasting,
but the fury of the sea, which knows no invincible adversary,
has laid them low. Every coast-line shows the destructive
effects of the sea, for the bays and coves, the caves at the bases
of the cliffs, the buttresses, stocks, needles, and skerries, are the
work of the waves. And this work is constantly going on.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Even a blind man could not stand long upon a shingly beach
without knowing that the sea was busily at work. Every
wave that rolls in from the open ocean hurls the pebbles up
the slope of the beach, and then as soon as the wave has broken
and the water has dispersed, these pebbles come rattling down
with the currents that sweep back to the sea. The clatter of
the beach thus tells us plainly that as the stones are being
dragged up and down they are constantly knocked against
each other; and it is evident that by such rough usage all
<a id="pg002"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg002]</span>
angular fragments of rock will soon have their corners
rounded off and become rubbed into the form of pebbles. As
these pebbles are rolled to and fro upon the beach they get
worn smaller and smaller, until at length they are reduced to
the state of sand. Although this sand is at first coarse, it
gradually becomes finer and finer as surely as though it were
ground in a mill; and ultimately it is carried out to sea as
fine sediment and laid down upon the ocean floor.
<a id="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">
 <a id="Footnote_1_1" href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span
 class="label">[1]</span></a> Huxley.
</div>

<p>The story of the sands is not only one of the conflict of the sea
and rocks; it is also a story of the winds. It is the winds that
have rescued them from the waves and driven them about, sifting
and assorting them, arranging them in graceful forms, and often
heaping them up into dunes which, until fastened by vegetation,
are themselves ever moved onward by the same force, sometimes
burying fertile lands, trees, and even houses in their march.
The sands, moreover, are in turn themselves destructive agents,
to whose power the many fragments which strew the beach and
dunes bear ample witness. The knotty sticks so commonly seen
on the beach are often the hearts of oak-&#160;or cedar-trees from
which the tiny crystals of sand have slowly cut away their less
solid outer growth. Everything, in fact, upon the sands is
"beach-worn," even to the window-glass of life-saving stations,
which is frequently so ground that it loses its transparency in a
single storm.</p>

<p>The beach is also a vast sarcophagus holding myriads of the
dead. "If ghosts be ever laid, here lie ghosts of creatures innumerable,
vexing the mind in the attempt to conceive them."
And there are certain sands which may be said to sing their
requiem, the so-called musical sands, like the "Singing Beach"
at Manchester-by-the-Sea, which emit sounds when struck or otherwise
disturbed. On some beaches these sounds resemble rumbling,
on others hooting; sometimes they are bell-like and even rhythmical.
The cause of this sonorous character is not definitely
known, but it is possibly due to films of compressed gases which
separate each grain as with a cushion, and the breaking of which
<a id="pg003"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg003]</span>
causes, in the aggregate, considerable vibrations. Such sands
are not uncommon, having been recorded in many places, and
they exist probably in many others where they have escaped
observation. They may be looked for above the water-line,
where the sand is dry and clean.</p>

<p>We have to do, however, in this volume, not with the history
of the past, nor with the action of physical forces, but with
the life of the present, and to find this, in its abundance,
one must go down near the margin of the water, where the sands
are wet. There is no solitude here; the place is teeming with
living things. As each wave retreats, little bubbles of air are
plentiful in its wake. Underneath the sand, where each bubble rose,
lives some creature, usually a mollusk, perhaps the razor-shell
<em class="e000I2">Solen ensis</em>. By the jet of water which
spurts out of the sand, the common clam <em class="e000I2">Mya
arenaria</em> reveals the secret of its abiding-place. A curious
groove or furrow here and there leads to a spot where <em
class="e000I2">Polynices heros</em> has gone below; and the many
shells scattered about, pierced with circular holes, tell how <em
class="e000I2">Polynices</em> and <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>
made their breakfast and their dinner. Only the lifting of a
shovelful of sand at the water's edge is needed to disclose the
populous community of mollusks, worms, and crustaceans living at
our feet, just out of sight.</p>

<p>Even the tracks and traces of these little beings are full of
information. What may be read in the track of a bird on the
sand is thus described by a noted ornithologist:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Here are foot-notes again, this time of real steps from real
feet.&#160;.&#160;.&#160;. The imprints are in two parallel lines, an inch or
so apart; each impression is two or three inches in advance
of the next one behind; none of them are in pairs, but each
one of one line is opposite the middle of the interval between
two of the other line; they are steps as regular as a man's,
only so small. Each mark is fan-shaped; it consists of three
little lines less than an inch long, spreading apart at one extremity,
joined at the other. At the joined end, and also just
in front of it, a flat depression of the sand is barely visible.
Now following the track, we see it run straight a yard or
<a id="pg004"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg004]</span>
more, then twist into a confused ball, then shoot out straight
again, then stop, with a pair of the footprints opposite each
other, different from the other end of the track, that began
as two or three little indistinct pits or scratches, not forming
perfect impressions of a foot. Where the track twisted there
are several little round holes in the sand. The whole track
commenced and finished upon the open sand. The creature
that made it could not, then, have come out of either the
sand or the water; it must have come down from the air—a
two-legged flying thing, a bird. To determine this, and, next,
what kind of bird it was, every one of the trivial points of the
description just given must be taken into account. It is a
bit of autobiography, the story of an invitation to dine, acceptance,
a repast, an alarm at the table, a hasty retreat. A
bird came on wing, lowering till the tips of its toes just
touched the sand, gliding half on wing, half afoot, until the
impetus of flight was exhausted; then folding its wings, but
not pausing, for already a quick eye spied something inviting;
a hasty pecking and probing to this side and that, where we
found the lines entangled; a short run after more food; then
a suspicious object attracted its attention; it stood stock-still
(just where the marks were in a pair), till, thoroughly
alarmed, it sprang on wing and was off.<a id="FNanchor_2_2"
href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote">
 <a id="Footnote_2_2" href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span
 class="label">[2]</span></a> Elliott Coues.
</div>

<p>Following the key further, he draws more conclusions. The
tracks are not in pairs, so the bird does not belong to the perchers;
therefore it must be a wader or a swimmer. There are no
web-marks to indicate the latter; hence it is a three-toed walking
or wading bird. It had flat, long, narrow, and pointed wings
because it came gliding swiftly and low, and scraped the sand
before its wings were closed. This is shown by the few scratches
before the prints became perfect. A certain class of birds thus
arrests the impetus of flight. It had a long feeling-bill, as shown
by the little holes in the sands where the marks became entangled;
and so on. These combined characteristics belong to one
class of birds and to no other; so he knows as definitely as
<a id="pg005"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg005]</span>
though he had seen the bird that a sandpiper alighted here for a
brief period, for here is his signature.</p>

<p>It is plain that tracks in the sand mean as much to the naturalist
as do tracks in the snow to the hunter, and trails on the
land to the Indian who follows his course by signs not seen by
an untrained eye.</p>

<p>The tide effaces much that is written by foot and wing, but
sometimes such signs are preserved and become veritable "footprints
on the sands of time." In the Museum of Natural History
in New York is a fossil slab, taken from the Triassic sandstone,
showing the footprints of a dinosaurian reptile now extinct,
which, in that long ago, walked across a beach—an event unimportant
enough in itself, but more marvelous than any tale of
imagination when recorded for future ages. From such tracks,
together with fragments of skeletons, the dinosaur has been
made to live again, and its form and structure have been as
clearly defined as those of the little sandpiper of Dr. Coues.

<h3 title="II. Collecting"><a id="II-Collecting"></a>II<br />
COLLECTING</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>It has been said that everything on the land has its counterpart
in the sea. But all land animals are separate and independent
individuals, while many of those of the sea are united into
organic associations comprising millions of individuals inseparably
connected and many of them interdependent, such as corals,
hydroids, etc. These curious communities can be compared only
to the vegetation of the land, which many of them resemble in
outer form. Other stationary animals, such as oysters and
barnacles, which also depend upon floating organisms for their
food, have no parallel on the land.</p>

<p>The water is crowded with creatures which prey upon one
another, and all are interestingly adapted to their mode of life.
Shore species are exceedingly abundant, and the struggle for life
is there carried on with unceasing strife. In the endeavor to
escape pursuers while they themselves pursue, these animals
have various devices of armature and weapons of defense; they
have keen vision, rapid motion, and are full of arts and wiles.
One of the first resources for safety in this conflict is that of concealment.
This is effected not only by actual hiding, but very
generally by mimicry in simulating the color of their surroundings,
and often by assuming other forms. Thus, for instance,
the sea-anemone when expanded looks like a flower and is full of
color, but when it contracts becomes so inconspicuous as to be
with difficulty distinguished from the rock to which it is attached.
Anemones also have stinging threads (nematophores), which they dart
out for further defense. <a id="pg007"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg007]</span></p>

<p>The study of biology has great fascination, and the subject
seldom fails to awaken interest as soon as the habit of observation
is formed. Jellyfishes, hardly more dense than the water
and almost as limpid, swimming about with graceful motion,
often illuminating the water at night with their phosphorescence,
showing sensitiveness, volition, and order in their lives, cannot
fail to excite wonder in even the most careless observer. Not
less interesting are the thousands of other animals which crowd
the shores, lying just beneath the surface of the sand, filling
crevices in the rocks, hiding under every projection, or boldly—perhaps
timidly, who shall say?—lying in full view, yet so inconspicuous
that they are easily passed by unnoticed.</p>

<p>To find these creatures, to study their habits and organization,
to consider the wonderful order of nature, leads through delightful
paths into the realms of science. But even without scientific
study the simple observation of the curious objects which lie at
one's feet as one walks along the beach is a delightful pastime.</p>

<p>The features which separate the classes and the orders of both
the plant and the animal life are so distinctive that it requires
but very superficial observation to know them. It is easy to
discriminate between mollusks, echinoderms, and polyps, and to
recognize the relationship between univalves and bivalves, sea-urchins
and starfishes, sea-anemones and corals. The equally
plain distinctions between the branched, unbranched, tubular,
and plate-like green algæ make them as easy to separate.</p>

<p>The pleasure of a walk through field or forest is enhanced by
knowing something of the trees and flowers, and in the same way
a visit to the sea-shore becomes doubly interesting when one has
some knowledge, even though it be a very superficial one, of the
organisms which inhabit the shore.</p>

<h4 title="Rocky Shores">ROCKY SHORES</h4>

<p>Rocky shores furnish an abundance and great variety of objects
to the collector. The seaweeds here find places of attachment,
and the lee and crevices of the rocks afford shelter to many animals
which could not live in more open and exposed places. The
<a id="pg008"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg008]</span>
rock pools harbor species whose habitat is below low-water mark
and which could not otherwise bear the alternation of the tides.</p>

<p>The first objects on the rocky beach to attract attention are
the barnacles and rockweeds. They are conspicuous in their profusion,
the former incrusting the rocks with their white shells,
and the latter forming large beds of vegetation; yet both are
likely to be passed by with indifference because of their plentifulness.
They are, however, not only interesting in themselves,
but associated with them are many organisms which are easily
overlooked. The littoral zone is so crowded with life that there
is a constant struggle for existence,—even for standing-room, it
may be said,—and no class of animals has undisputed possession
of any place. Therefore the collector should carefully search
any object he gathers for other organisms which may be upon it,
under it, or even in it, such as parasites, commensals, and the
organisms which hide under it or attach themselves to it for support.
Let the rockweed (<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>) be carefully examined. Among
the things likely to be found attached to its fronds are periwinkles
(<em class="e000I2">Littorina litorea</em>), which simulate the plant in color, some shells
being striped for closer mimicry. Sertularian hydroids also are
there, zigzagging over the fronds or forming tufts of delicate
horny branches upon them. Small jelly-like masses at the broad
divisions of the fronds may be compound ascidians. Calcareous
spots here and there may be polyzoans of exquisite form, while
spread in incrusting sheets over considerable spaces are other
species of <em class="e000I2">Polyzoa</em>. Tiny flat shelly spirals are the worm-cases of
<em class="e000I2">Spirorbis</em>. A pocket-lens is essential to enable one to appreciate
the beauty of these minute forms. Under the rockweeds are
many kinds of crustaceans; perhaps there will also be patches of
the pink urn-like egg-capsules of <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em> at the base of the fucus.</p>

<p>Various kinds of seaweed abound in the more sheltered parts
of the rocks, and among them will be found amphipods and isopods,
many of which are of species different from those of the
sandy beaches. Here, too, is the little <em class="e000I2">Caprella</em>, imitating the
seaweed in form, and swaying its lengthened body, which is
attached to the plant only by its hind legs. On the seaweeds, as
well as in the tide-pool, may be found beautiful hydroids, and on
<a id="pg009"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg009]</span>
them the curious little sea-spiders (<em class="e000I2">Pycnogonidæ</em>), animals which
seem to be all legs.</p>

<p>Mollusks, and other classes as well, differ in different latitudes.
On the rocks of the Northern shores <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em> and <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em> shells
are very abundant, the latter in various colors and beautifully
striped. Limpets are also plentiful, but are not as conspicuous,
since they have flat, disk-shaped shells. When their capture is
attempted, they must be taken unawares and pushed quickly
aside, else they take such a firm hold of the rock that it is difficult
to dislodge them. Near low-water mark under ledges will
perhaps be found chitons, which are easily recognized by their
oval, jointed shells. On the California coast in like localities
will be found the beautiful <em class="e000I2">Haliotis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em>, and chitons. Every
stone that is lifted will disclose numbers of little amphipods
(<em class="e000I2">Gammarus</em>), which will scuttle away on their sides to other
shelter; worms will suddenly disappear into the mud, and perhaps
a crab, here and there, having no alternative, will make a
stand and fight for his liberty. Flat against the stone and not
easily perceived may be a chiton, a planarian worm, or a nudibranch.
And just below the water's edge are sea-urchins and
starfishes, which grow in numbers as the eye becomes accustomed
to the search.</p>

<p>The rock pools are natural aquaria, more interesting by far
than any prepared by man. The possibilities of these little sea-gardens
are beyond enumeration. The longer one studies them
the more one finds. In them all classes of seaweeds and marine
invertebrates may be found and their habits watched. The great
beauty of these pools gives them an esthetic charm apart from
the scientific interest they excite. Perhaps one may find here a
sponge, and removing it to a shallow vessel of sea-water can
watch the currents of water it creates. Several sponges of the
same species placed in contact will at the end of two days be
closely united. If the sponges are of different species they will
not coalesce.</p>

<p>In the clefts and crannies of the rocks are various fine seaweeds,
often of the red varieties, sea-anemones, hydroids, polyzoans,
crustaceans, mollusks, and ascidians. Crabs will be snugly
<a id="pg010"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg010]</span>
ensconced under projecting surfaces. Most species are more
plentiful at the lowest-water mark, and many are found only at
this point and below.</p>

<h4 title="Sandy Shores">SANDY SHORES</h4>

<p>On sandy shores the greater part of the inhabitants live under
the surface. Many give evidence of their presence by the open
mouths of their burrows, and some distinctly point out these
places by piles of sand or mud in coils at the opening. Some
tubicolous worms have their tubes projecting above the surface.
The tubes of <em class="e000I2">Diopatra</em> are hung with bits of shells, seaweeds, and
other foreign matter. Some mollusks announce themselves by
spurting jets of water or sending bubbles of air from the sand.
The majority of the underground species, however, give no sign
of their presence on the surface, and must be found by digging.
Many of them go deep into the sand, and in searching for worms
the digger must be quick-&#160;and expert, or he will lose entirely or
cut in two many of the most beautiful ones, which retreat quickly
and to the extremity of their holes at the least alarm. One can
be a rambler on the sandy beach for a long time without being
aware of the many beautiful objects which inhabit the subsurface
of the sand. The curious crab <em class="e000I2">Hippa</em> will disappear so quickly
into the sand that one is hardly sure he has really seen it. The
vast number of worms will surprise any one who searches for
them by their variety, their beautiful color, and their interesting
shapes. Here again a glass is requisite to appreciate the delicacy
and beauty of their locomotive organs, their branchiæ, and so on.
The most common of the gasteropod mollusks on sandy shores
are <em class="e000I2">Nassa obsoleta</em>, <em class="e000I2">Nassa trivittata</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Polynices (Lunatia) heros</em>.
The last are detected by the little mounds of sand which they
push before them as they plow their way just below the surface.
On more southern beaches, <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>, <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Pyrula</em> are the
common varieties. <em class="e000I2">Olivella</em>, <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Donax</em>, also inhabitants of
sandy beaches, will quickly disappear when uncovered by the
waves, being rapid burrowers. Most of the many dead shells on
the beach will be found to be pierced with a round hole, which is
<a id="pg011"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg011]</span> drilled by the file-like tongue, or lingual ribbon, of <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Urosalpinx</em>, or <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>, which thus reach the animal within and
suck out its substance. Another similar species is <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em>
(<em class="e000I2">Neverita</em>) <em class="e000I2">duplicata</em>, which extends to the Gulf of Mexico, while
<em class="e000I2">P. heros</em> is not commonly found below Hatteras. Crustaceans
are abundant on the sandy beach over its whole breadth. Some
of the sand-crabs live above tide-mark. Among these is the
fleet-footed <em class="e000I2">Ocypoda</em>, which is interesting to watch. Often they
go in numbers to the water's edge and throw up mounds, behind
which they crouch like cats, watching for whatever prey the tide
may bring up. When unable to outrun a pursuer they rush into
the surf and remain there until the danger is past. The wet
sand is often thickly perforated with the burrows of the sandhoppers
(<em class="e000I2">Orchestia</em>). These often rise about the feet as do grasshoppers
in the fields.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Hippa talpoida</em> is a remarkable crab, somewhat resembling an
egg. It is not likely to be seen unless searched for by digging
at the water's edge. It burrows so rapidly that one must be
quick to catch it after it is exposed by the shovel. In some
places the tests of "sand-dollars" are common. The living
animal may be found buried just below the surface at extreme
low-water mark.</p>

<p>The sea-wrack drifted in lines along the shore will repay careful
examination, for here will be found many things belonging
to other shores and deep water. It is often alive with sandhoppers,
which hop away while one searches for less common
things. Often the most delicate seaweeds, numerous small shells,
worms, polyzoans, etc., will be found there.</p>

<p>The surface of the sand-beach is strewn with remains of many
species, usually beach-worn, but interesting nevertheless as examples
of species one would like to find in better condition, but
good specimens of which elude ordinary search or are unobtainable
except by dredging.</p>

<p>Egg-cases form another class of objects which are often
gathered with no idea of their identity. Of these the most common
are the long strings of saucer-like capsules which contain
the eggs of the mollusk <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>, those having square edges being
<a id="pg012"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg012]</span>
the egg-cases of <em class="e000I2">F. carica</em>, and those having sharp edges those of
<em class="e000I2">F. canaliculata</em>. Collar-like sandy rings contain the eggs of
<em class="e000I2">Polynices</em> (<em class="e000I2">Lunatia</em>), which are cemented together in this shape.
The boys of Cape Cod call them "tommy-cod houses." Cylindrical
piles of little capsules, sometimes called "ears of corn," hold
the eggs of <em class="e000I2">Chrysodomus</em>. The irregular masses of small hemispherical
capsules are those of the common whelk (<em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>).
The so-called "Devil's pocket-books" are the egg-cases of the skate.</p>

<h4 title="Muddy Shores">MUDDY SHORES</h4>

<p>On muddy shores the eel-grass (<em class="e000I2">Zostera marina</em>) grows abundantly,
giving an appearance of submerged meadows. It is one
of the very few flowering plants which live in salt water. In
summer its little green blossoms may be seen in grooves on the
leaf-like blades. Many animals live on and among eel-grass.
Found upon it is the delicate gasteropod mollusk <em class="e000I2">Lacuna vincta</em>,
and its eggs in little rings; the iridescent <em class="e000I2">Margarita helicina</em>, and
<em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>, with its bright-yellow eggs in small gelatinous masses;
also little worms (<em class="e000I2">Spirorbis</em>) in tiny flat spiral shells, compound
ascidians in jelly-like masses, clusters of shelly or horny polyzoans,
isopods, planarian worms, and so on. Scallops (<em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>)
will be found at the base of the plants, and the common prawns
are very numerous, swimming freely about. Mud flats and
shores are the homes of many mollusks, especially of <em class="e000I2">Nassa obsoleta</em>,—which
is the most abundant shell of any considerable size
from Cape Cod to the Gulf of Mexico,—and of vast numbers of the
tiny <em class="e000I2">Littorinella minuta</em>, which serve as food for fishes and aquatic
birds. Clams and worms of all varieties are also abundant.</p>

<p>There are many varieties of mud-crabs, of which the most common
are the "fiddlers," which honeycomb the banks and the surface
of salt-marshes with their burrows. The common edible
crab <em class="e000I2">Callinectes hastatus</em> is plentiful in bays and estuaries. The
sluggish spider-crabs hide beneath the surface of the mud and in
decaying weeds and eel-grass. Hermit-crabs are plentiful here
as well as elsewhere. <em class="e000I2">Panopeus</em> is a sluggish crab found in shallow
water and in all sorts of hiding-places along the shore. It <a id="pg013"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg013]</span>
may often be found in dead shells, and, in the South, in holes in
the banks. This genus is represented by a number of species,
some of which are quite pretty.</p>

<h4 title="Wharves And Bridges">WHARVES AND BRIDGES</h4>

<p>On the piles of wharves and bridges may often be found beautiful
tubularian hydroids in large tufts just below low-water
mark, branched hydroids looking like little shrubs, polyzoans,
sea-anemones, mollusks, and ascidians. The species peculiar to
these localities are the boring mollusk <em class="e000I2">Teredo navalis</em>, or ship-worm,
the boring isopod <em class="e000I2">Limnoria lignorum</em>, and the boring
amphipod <em class="e000I2">Chelura terebrans</em>, all of which penetrate the wood and
are most destructive.</p>

<p>The animals and plants of tropical beaches and coral reefs are
so various and abundant, so curious and beautiful, as to make a
description or even an enumeration of them in a brief space difficult.
The collector is bewildered and excited when he first views
the profusion of the wonderful forms there found.</p>

<p>It is not generally known that a fine species of "stony coral"
is common from Cape Cod southward, growing in clear water as
an incrustation on rocks, and developing little spires as it
advances in age. This species, the <em class="e000I2">Astrangia danaë</em>, is especially
interesting, since it will live in a dish of clear sea-water, and the
polyps will expand, showing a very close relationship to the sea-anemone.
With care in changing the water this coral will live
for days, and may be examined in its expanded condition with a
lens of moderate power.</p>

<p>The most favorable time for collecting on any beach is at the
lowest tide, many objects being then uncovered which do not
appear higher up on the beach. At the spring-tides, which occur
twice a month, at the period of the new and that of the full
moon, the ebb is especially low, and affords an opportunity to
search for forms whose habitat is below ordinary low-water
mark. During storms deep-water forms are often torn from their
beds and cast upon the beach. Shore-collecting at these times is
often very interesting. <a id="pg014"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg014]</span></p>

<h4 title="Equipment For Collecting Invertebrates">EQUIPMENT FOR COLLECTING INVERTEBRATES</h4>

<p>The equipment for collecting upon sandy beaches is a shovel,
a sieve, and a net. Numerous trials should be made with the
shovel from about half-tide mark to as deep as one cares to wade,
and the sand raised should be carefully searched for shells, crustaceans,
and worms. By washing out the sand in the sieve the
smallest specimens, which might otherwise escape notice, may be
secured. On a rocky beach a strong knife and a net are sufficient.
It is well to have a number of homeopathic vials for small
specimens, which will be injured by contact with larger forms,
and jars for holding the general collection.</p>

<h4 title="Preserving Invertebrates">PRESERVING INVERTEBRATES</h4>

<p>To preserve specimens, they should first be placed in a weak
solution of alcohol, the strength of which should be increased
gradually until the animal is entirely free from water and is
hardened throughout. If the alcohol becomes colored and sediment
falls to the bottom of the jar, the animal is degenerating,
and the alcohol should be changed. Specimens for transportation
can be packed by wrapping each one in a bit of cheese-cloth
and then placing them together in a large receptacle. Care
should be taken to keep the fragile specimens separate. Sand-dollars
possess a pigment which discolors and soon vitiates alcohol,
and consequently these should be separated from the other forms
and placed where the alcohol may be changed from time to time
as appears necessary. The homeopathic vials containing small
specimens may be put into the can without injury to the other
specimens. Special cans of various sizes, with handles and screw
covers, are made for naturalists. One of these cans is a convenient
receptacle for carrying the alcohol to the station and
for receiving the collection for transportation. Careful notes
should be made on the spot of the conditions under which the
species are found. One is likely to forget details if this is delayed
until one reaches home. Labels should be used, giving
name when known, or a number when the name is not known, <a id="pg015"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg015]</span>
corresponding with the note-book. Names written with lead-pencil
on a slip of paper will not be defaced by or injure the
alcohol. Collections when arranged permanently should be
placed in glass jars, the species being kept separate.</p>

<h4 title="Collecting And Preserving Seaweeds">COLLECTING AND PRESERVING SEAWEEDS</h4>

<p>To collect seaweeds one must search for them on rocks, in
tide-pools, in the sea-wrack upon the beach, on piles of wharves,
on eel-grass, and on the surface of incoming waves. It is well to
follow the receding tide and take advantage of its lowest ebb
(especially of that of the spring-tides, as mentioned above) to
search the extreme limit of the beach in the short time it is
exposed. Many of the red seaweeds are found there.</p>

<p>The equipment for collecting consists of a basket, two small
tin pails, one small enough to be carried within the other, a staff
with an iron edge at one end and a small net at the other, and a
pocket-lens. Rockweeds (<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>) or other coarse gelatinous seaweeds
should be put into the basket. The pails, half filled with
sea-water, will receive the other specimens, fine and delicate algæ
being put into the smaller pail. It is well to have a second small
receptacle for <em class="e000I2">Callithamnion</em> and <em class="e000I2">Griffithsia</em>, if one can be further
burdened. <em class="e000I2">Desmarestia</em> should be kept apart, if possible, since it
discolors and decomposes other algæ; it should also have the
earliest attention when the time comes for mounting, and salt
water should be used for floating it upon the mount, otherwise
the beauty of the specimen will be impaired.</p>

<p>Besides its use as a support, the staff is needed to dislodge
specimens from the rocks, and the net to secure those that are
floating just out of reach. When possible, it is desirable to secure
the whole plant, including the holdfast, and to gather several
plants of the same species, since they vary with age and other
conditions, and it is also well to have duplicates for exchange.
It is particularly desirable to obtain plants which are in fruit.
Each specimen as it is taken should be rinsed in the sea-water to
free it from sand.</p>

<p>Collections should be mounted as soon as convenient, and <a id="pg016"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg016]</span>
especial care in this respect should be taken with red algæ, as
they decompose quickly. The requisites for mounting are
blotters, pieces of muslin, two or more smooth boards, weights,
a basin, and several shallow dishes containing water. Fresh
water has a strong action on the color and substance of seaweeds,
and specimens should not be left in it for any length of time.</p>

<p>Lift a specimen from the general collection, and in a basin of
deep water carefully wash off all superfluous matter; then place
it in shallow water and spread it out, trimming it judiciously, so
that when mounted it will not be too thick and the characteristics
be hidden. Specimens are more interesting and their species
more easily determined when laid out rather thin, showing their
branching and fruit. After the specimen is thus prepared, place
it in a second shallow dish of water. It should now be perfectly
clean. Float it out into the desired position, spreading it well,
letting some parts show the details of the branching, and other
parts the general natural effect of the mass. Run under it a
rather heavy sheet of white paper, and lift it carefully from the
water. If raised from the center, it is easier to let the water
subside evenly and gradually without disarranging the parts.
Some collectors find it better to float the specimen in water deep
enough to allow the left hand to be placed under the sheet to
raise it. Lay the sheet on a plate, and with a needle or forceps
rearrange any of the delicate parts which have fallen together.
A few drops of water placed on any portion will usually be sufficient
to enable one to separate the branchlets or ultimate ramifications.
A magnifying-glass will be useful in this work.</p>

<p>Cover a blotter with mounted specimens, spread over them a
piece of cotton cloth, and on this place another blotter, upon
which lay more mounted specimens and a cloth. Proceed in this
way until all the specimens are used. Lay the pile of blotters
between boards, and on them place the weights. The weights
should not be very heavy. Judgment must be used in assorting
the specimens, those that are fine being placed together. Those
that are coarse and likely to indent the blotters should be placed
between separate boards. In this way a flat surface and an even
pressure will be obtained. The blotters and cloths should be <a id="pg017"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg017]</span>
changed twice each of the first two days, then the cloths should
be removed and the specimens left in press for a week, the
blotters being changed daily. Be sure that the specimens are
perfectly dry before placing them in the herbarium. Label each
specimen with the name and the date and place of collection.</p>

<p>There are some seaweeds which cannot be treated in the above
manner. <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> if placed in fresh water soon becomes slimy.
It is so full of gelatine that it soon destroys blotters; therefore
it is well to hang it up for several hours and then place it between
newspapers, which should be frequently changed, and as the
plant becomes pliable it should be arranged in proper position.</p>

<p>Those specimens which do not adhere to paper in drying should
be secured with gum. When it is impossible to mount specimens
at the time they are collected, they can be preserved by
drying; afterward they can be soaked and mounted in the usual
manner. To dry the plants, lay them separately upon boards
without pressing out the sea-water, and leave them in an airy,
shaded place until thoroughly dry; then pack them loosely into
boxes and label, giving date and locality. Blotters or driers can
be obtained at botanical-supply stores at thirty-five cents per
quire.</p>

<h4 title="How To Arrange A Herbarium">HOW TO ARRANGE A HERBARIUM</h4>

<p>The standard herbarium-paper is sixteen by eleven and a half
inches. The sheets are single, white, smooth, and quite heavy.
These, together with folded sheets of yellow manila paper, called
genus-covers, are the only requisites. It is desirable to have also
a case of shelves protected by glass doors. The shelves should
be twelve by eighteen inches, and four to six inches apart. They
are more convenient when made to slide like drawers.</p>

<p>The different species of one genus are gummed on one or more
of the white sheets and placed within the folded manila paper,
which serves as a cover. Each specimen should be signed with
its name, place, and date of collection, thus:</p>

<p class="center padtb1">
<em class="e000I2">C. rubrum.</em>    Bar Harbor.    Aug. 12, 1899,
</p>

<p class="continue">
the generic name being indicated by its initial capital letter and
the specific name written in full. To this are often added the <a id="pg018"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg018]</span>
name of the collector and some interesting comment. On the
lower left-hand corner of the genus-cover is written the generic
name in full and the species of that genus which the cover contains,
thus:</p>

<table summary="example">
<tr>
 <td rowspan="3" class="mid"><em class="e000I2">Ceramium</em></td>

 <td><em class="e000I2">C. strictum</em></td></tr>
<tr>
 <td><em class="e000I2">C. diaphanum</em></td></tr>
</table>

<p>The genera of an order are then placed within a cover and labeled
in the same way, the legend then having the name of the order
on the left and the genera on the right of the bracket,<a id="FNanchor_TN" href="#Footnote_TN" class="fnanchor">[†]</a>
thus:</p>

<table summary="example">

</table>

<p>When the order is a large one the genera are distributed through
as many covers as may be necessary. The covers are then
arranged on shelves in the regular order of their classification,
and each shelf is labeled with the order it contains. Herbarium-sheets
cost at retail one dollar per hundred. Genus-covers cost
at retail one dollar and eighty cents per hundred. <a id="pg019"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg019]</span></p>

<h3 title="III. Classification"><a id="III-Classification">
</a>III<br />CLASSIFICATION</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The first great biological division is into kingdoms, namely,
the animal kingdom and the vegetable kingdom. Then by
classification the vast number of existing animals and plants are
grouped so as to give each individual a definite place. By this
system a beautiful order is established, which enables the student
to find any particular animal or plant he may wish to study, and
also to know its general characteristics from the name of the
group to which it belongs.</p>

<p>In broad generalization, objects of wide dissimilarity are recognized
as belonging to the same kingdom, as do trees and
grasses, or as do birds and fishes. Certain trees or grasses and
certain birds or fishes have such points of resemblance that they
plainly show that they belong to subdivisions. The most untutored
people recognize these distinctions, but the naturalist goes
further and finds points of distinction which the casual observer
overlooks.</p>

<p>The animal kingdom has a varying number of divisions, called
<em class="e000I2">branches</em>, <em class="e000I2">subkingdoms</em>, or <em class="e000I2">phyla</em>. Some late authors have admitted
twelve divisions, and have given them the name <em class="e000I2">phyla</em>. Each
phylum is composed of a group of animals with a plan of structure
which is common to themselves, but differs from that of the
animals of all other phyla.</p>

<p>The higher animals begin with the twelfth phylum, namely,
the <em class="e000I2">Chordata</em>, or vertebrates. These animals have a spinal
column, or series of vertebræ, while the lower animals, or invertebrates
are without a spinal column, and depend for stability <a id="pg020"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg020]</span>
upon muscles or coriaceous or calcareous coverings. The vertebrates
are first represented in the fish-like forms. Bilateral symmetry,
however, or the uniform arrangement of parts on each
side of a central axis, exists in several groups which are below
the vertebrates, the first pronounced example being found in
worms. Groups lower than worms have their organs arranged
around a central axis or radiating from it, and were once all
classed as <em class="e000I2">radiates</em>.</p>

<p>An animal is classified in accordance with its morphology,
anatomy, histology, and embryology. Morphology determines
its general shape, the position of its limbs, eyes, and mouth, and
the covering of its body; anatomy, the arrangement of its internal
organs, such as the position of its heart, lungs, stomach, etc.;
histology, the character of the tissues of the body; and embryology,
the method of the development of the animal from the
embryo to maturity. It is only after these exact discriminations
have been made that the groups are arranged. Owing to the
greater accuracy resulting from histology and embryology
(methods which have been employed only in later years), many
changes in classification have been made, and as science advances
will continue to be made.</p>

<p>The primary groups are based on broad general characteristics,
but their divisions and subdivisions are determined by closer
distinctions. Animals having shells differ from those having a
cartilaginous or those having a crustaceous covering, and are
placed in different groups. Yet mollusks having a single or a
double shell, having spiral or flat forms, living on land, in fresh
water, or in the sea, while differing from one another, are all of
one group. Lobsters and crabs, although both have crustaceous
coverings, are very unlike; and again, there are many species of
both lobsters and crabs.</p>

<p>To group individuals, noting resemblances as well as differences,
a system of classification has been arranged with the following
divisions:</p>

<p>Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Family (or Suborder), Genus,
Species. <a id="pg021"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg021]</span></p>

<h3 title="IV. Animal Life in its Lowest Forms">
<a id="IV_animal_life_in_its_lowest_forms"></a>
IV<br /> ANIMAL LIFE IN ITS LOWEST FORMS</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The biological division, or discrimination, between animal
and vegetable life, is based on the manner of assimilating
food. Plants feed upon mineral substances, or, in other words,
assimilate inorganic matter, while animal life requires for its
support vegetable or some other organic matter.</p>

<p>Animal as well as vegetable life in its lowest forms begins
with one-celled organisms, which are called respectively <em class="e000I2">Protozoa</em>
(first animals) and <em class="e000I2">Protophyta</em> (first plants). Both of these divisions
are composed mostly of microscopic objects, and, together
with other minute forms of life of the marine species, constitute
a great part of the <em class="e000I2">plankton</em>, or free-floating organisms of the sea.
These minute organisms seem like connecting-links between the
two kingdoms. They were claimed by both botanists and zoölogists
until the use of the microscope made close observation of
minute structure possible.</p>

<p>Among the small animalcules of the phylum <em class="e000I2">Protozoa</em> are some
which are familiar to all by name, such as the <em class="e000I2">Infusoria</em>, which
are most interesting creatures to examine in a drop of water
under the microscope. A more tangible example of the <em class="e000I2">Protozoa</em>
are the <em class="e000I2">Foraminifera</em>. <em class="e000I2">Foraminifera</em>, like diatoms, have a shell-like
covering, and these shells, among the most plentiful of which
are those of the genus <em class="e000I2">Globigerina</em>, fall, as do those of diatoms,
in immense numbers to the bottom of the ocean, and form respectively
what are known as <em class="e000I2">Globigerina</em> and diatomaceous ooze.
In course of time the sedimentary strata become fossilized; thus,
the stone of which the city of Paris is built consists of fossilized <a id="pg022"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg022]</span>
foraminifers, and the pyramids of Egypt are built of nummulites,
another genus of <em class="e000I2">Foraminifera</em>. It is estimated that an ounce
of this deposit contains four millions of these protozoans, so it is
impossible to conceive the numbers of once living animals represented
in the tombs of the Pharaohs. Telegraph-cables raised
from the depth of two miles bring the message to naturalists
that the bottom of the ocean at that depth is composed of little
else than the calcareous shells of <em class="e000I2">Foraminifera</em>.</p>

<p>Many of the lower animals resemble plants in form. Hydroids
and polyzoans are often gathered and preserved as seaweeds.
Corals, sea-anemones, and holothurians are curiously like plants.
For a time the confusion about the division of animals and plants
was partly owing to this resemblance of forms, and the theory
of the animal nature of corals was for a long time considered to
be refuted by the testimony of a naturalist who declared that he
had seen them in bloom. Later this class of animals was
believed to occupy an intermediate sphere and partake of the
characteristics of both kingdoms. The name zoöphyte, meaning
"animal-plant" or "mingled life," was adopted because of these
resemblances and was formerly applied to these forms only.
To-day it has a broader application. There is still a neutral class,
called <em class="e000I2">Protista</em>, comprising organisms which have not yet been
classified as plants or animals. <a id="pg023"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg023]</span></p>

<h3 title="V. Distribution of Animal Life in the Sea"><a id="V_distribution_of_animal_life_in_the_sea"></a>V<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF ANIMAL LIFE IN THE SEA</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>All living things which inhabit the sea have their appointed
boundaries, and the localization of marine life is as distinct
as is that of terrestrial life. Each kind of beach has forms of life
peculiar to itself. Those animals which inhabit rocky shores or
stony beaches or sand or mud may be looked for anywhere under
similar physical surroundings. They are, however, modified by
climatic conditions, and in wide ranges differ in genera and
species. The rocky coast of Maine has a class of sea-urchins and
starfishes which are different from those which live on the rocky
shores of the northern Pacific coast, yet they are all easily recognized
as belonging to the same family, and a description of
typical forms is a sufficient guide to the recognition of their
relationships.</p>

<p>A bathymetrical division defines the classes of animals according
to the depth of water in which they live. Those which live
near the shore are <em class="e000I2">littoral</em> species, those of the broad sea are
<em class="e000I2">pelagic</em>, while those living at great depths are <em class="e000I2">abyssal</em>.</p>

<p>Their modes of life are distinguished by other terms. Those
which float at or near the surface and are carried about by the
currents, like the jellyfishes and the minute organisms mentioned
elsewhere, are <em class="e000I2">plankton</em>. Strong swimming animals which move
about at will are <em class="e000I2">nekton</em>. Those which are fixed, like oysters,
sponges, etc., and those which crawl on the bottom, like crabs,
echinoderms, etc., are <em class="e000I2">benthos</em>.</p>

<p>Again, geographical divisions are named, in recognition of
climatic influences. The <em class="e000I2">boreal</em> fauna and flora on the Atlantic <a id="pg024"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg024]</span>
coast extend from Cape Cod northward; the <em class="e000I2">American</em>, from
Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras; the <em class="e000I2">West Indian</em>, from Cape Hatteras
southward. On the Pacific coast the divisions, without definite
names, are from the Isthmus to Acapulco, Acapulco to the
Gulf of California, Cape Lucas to the Strait of Fuca. These
divisions merge at indefinite lines, but the above limits are
generally accepted as the points of broad division.</p>

<p>The shore or littoral fauna is especially abundant and comprises
more species that are curious in form and beautiful in
color than the others. The invertebrates of the deep sea are
mostly transparent and of a blue or violet tint, while the fishes
are gray or bluish above and white beneath, which renders them
inconspicuous to their enemies. <a id="pg025"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg025]</span></p>

<h3 title="VI. Some Botanical Facts About Algæ">
<a id="VI_some_botanical_facts_about_algae"></a>VI<br /> SOME BOTANICAL
FACTS ABOUT ALGÆ</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The vegetable world is separated into two great divisions:
<em class="e000I2">thallophytes</em>, or plants having no distinction of leaf or stem,
and <em class="e000I2">cormophytes</em>, or plants which have leaves and stems. All
thallophytes that live in the water and are nourished wholly by
water are called <em class="e000I2">algæ</em>.</p>

<p>A second great division of plants is into <em class="e000I2">cryptogams</em>, or those
that have no flowers, and <em class="e000I2">phanerogams</em>, or those that have flowers,
by means of which seeds are produced and successive generations
of plant life continued.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Thallophytes</em> and <em class="e000I2">cryptogams</em> comprise the lowest and simplest
vegetable organisms. Algæ belong to both these divisions; to
the first because they have neither stems nor leaves, and to the
second because they have no flowers.</p>

<p>The lowest forms of algæ are microscopic in size, each individual
being a single cell; but in the ascending scale they attain
curious and beautiful shapes, some growing to a gigantic size
and in forms that resemble shrubs and trees. The green surface
commonly seen on the shady side of trees, on stone steps, and
in other damp places is one of the species of algæ which consist
of a single cell. This plant or cell divides, and the separate divisions
divide and subdivide again and again, and in time the
aggregate number is great enough to spread over a comparatively
large surface, and thus become visible to the naked eye. This
plant, the <em class="e000I2">Pleurococcus vulgaris</em>, is a fresh-water alga. The <em class="e000I2">Protococcus
nivalis</em>, or red snow, described on <a href="#pg033">page 33</a>, is a closely
allied species. The green and blue-green scums and slimes on <a id="pg026"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg026]</span>
brackish ditches and on the stones and woodwork of wharves are
also species of the lowest orders of algæ and increase by cell-division.
Many of them are in colonies incased in gelatinous
matter. These, together with plants of a little higher order,
though still of low organization, the <em class="e000I2">Confervaceæ</em>, form a large
part of the green vegetation between tide-marks.</p>

<p>The vegetative body of a thallophyte is a <em class="e000I2">thallus</em>, and corresponds
to stem and leaf. It is also called a <em class="e000I2">frond</em>. What
corresponds to the root of flowering plants is in algæ a disk or
conical expansion of the base of the plant. It is simply a holdfast
by which the frond attaches itself to any submerged material.
The algæ which grow on sandy shores and on corals have holdfasts
which branch like fibrous roots and penetrate porous substances
in all directions; but this is only for greater stability,
and is an adaptation to the habitat. Holdfasts do nothing for
algæ other than the name implies, whereas real roots absorb the
nourishment upon which plants live. Algæ are nourished by the
substances held in solution by the water which surrounds them.</p>

<p>Algæ are the lowest and simplest in organization of all plants,
because they are composed of but one class of cells, such as in
flowering plants are called the <em class="e000I2">parenchyma</em>, or soft cells, these
being the ones which compose the pulp of the leaf. In the lowest
orders of algæ single cells constitute individual plants, as in
<em class="e000I2">Pleurococcus</em>; but in the higher forms, such as <em class="e000I2">Sargassum</em>, they
arrange themselves in such a variety of combinations as to resemble
plants which have leaf and stem. The botanical distinction
is that in leaf and stem there would exist the woody and the
vascular cells as well as the parenchyma cells.</p>

<p>Beginning with plants composed of a single cell, the next
development is into filamentous plants, which are single thread-like
rows of cells, as in <em class="e000I2">Cladophora</em>. In <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em> is seen the earliest
type of an expanded leaf. The cells are here arranged in a horizontal
surface of plate-like or ribbon-like shape.</p>

<p>In <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em> there is a double layer of cells. The layers separate
in <em class="e000I2">Enteromorpha</em>, giving a hollow or tubular form. In <em class="e000I2">Monostroma</em>
a double layer is opened or torn apart, giving a frond with
a single layer of cells. <a id="pg027"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg027]</span></p>

<p>The stem-like forms of certain algæ are composed of cylindrical
cells which combine or grow in a longitudinal direction chiefly.
Sometimes the cells are arranged evenly, in which case the stem
seems articulated, as in some species of <em class="e000I2">Ceramium</em>. Again, they
are irregularly placed, so that the stem appears solid.</p>

<p>The highest types of algæ in the differentiation of parts, or
vegetative forms, are to be found in the <em class="e000I2">Fucaceæ</em>, of the brown
seaweeds; the highest in the reproductive development, in the
red class.</p>

<p>Reproduction by cell-division, in which the organism itself
breaks up into two or more individuals, is called <em class="e000I2">vegetative reproduction</em>.
Higher forms reproduce by spores, or germ-cells, which
give rise to new individuals on germination.</p>

<p>The substance of an alga is more or less firm, according as the
vegetable mucus or gelatinous matter it contains has more or less
consistency; it is <em class="e000I2">membranaceous</em> when the gelatine is scant and
glossy, <em class="e000I2">gelatinous</em> when it is abundant and fluid, and <em class="e000I2">cartilaginous</em>
when it is hard.</p>

<p>Some algæ are annuals; a few are perennials, and cast off and
renew their laminæ every season. Many plants present quite a
different appearance at different seasons of the year, and so are
often difficult to identify. Those which form spores throw off
these isolated cells, which sink or are washed to positions where
they germinate and begin their cycle of life. Many of the spores
begin their growth at once, without regard to season, so the
species is ever present. <a id="pg028"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg028]</span></p>

<h3 title="VII. Naming of Plants"><a id="VII-naming_of_plants"></a>
VII<br />NAMING OF PLANTS</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The real or technical names of plants, which at first appear
long and unpronounceable, are in reality simple when the
system of naming is understood. Every plant has a <em class="e000I2">generic</em> and
a <em class="e000I2">specific</em> name. The generic name is analogous to the surname of
a person, such as <em class="e000I2">Smith</em> or <em class="e000I2">Jones</em>. The specific name is analogous
to the Christian name of a person, such as <em class="e000I2">John</em> or <em class="e000I2">James</em>. The
specific name never stands alone, and would have as little designating
character as John&#160;—— or James&#160;——.</p>

<p>This is called the <em class="e000I2">binomial</em> (two-name) <em class="e000I2">nomenclature</em>. It was
introduced by Linnæus, and greatly simplified the system of
naming. The rule in scientific nomenclature is that all names
must be Latin or Latinized. This gives a universal language by
which scientists of all countries understand one another.</p>

<p>The names of classes (the highest groups) and subclasses are
adjectives or adjective nouns, expressing the most prominent
characteristic of the class or subclass. Thus the four subclasses
of the class <em class="e000I2">Algæ</em> are:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Cyanophyceæ</em> (subclass of blue-green algæ).</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Chlorophyceæ</em> (subclass of grass-green algæ).</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Phæophyceæ</em> (subclass of dusky-brown or olive-green algæ).</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Rhodophyceæ</em> or <em class="e000I2">Florideæ</em> (subclass of red algæ).</p>

<p>Orders are, with few exceptions, the names of genera with the
termination <em class="e000I2">-aceæ</em>, as:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Ulvaceæ</em>, from the genus <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Ectocarpaceæ</em>, from the genus <em class="e000I2">Ectocarpus</em>.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Gigartinaceæ</em>, from the genus <em class="e000I2">Gigartina</em>. <a id="pg029"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg029]</span></p>

<p>Suborders, or groups between orders and genera, terminate in
<em class="e000I2">-eæ</em>. Names of genera are nouns or words taken as nouns. They
are derived from any source,—from prominent or peculiar characteristics,
from localities, or from names of botanists,—or they
may be wholly arbitrary. Personal generic names are divested
of titles and take a final <em class="e000I2">a</em>, or, in many cases, for euphony, <em class="e000I2">ia</em>.
Thus, <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em> is the Latin for "sedge"; <em class="e000I2">Ectocarpus</em> is from two
Greek words meaning "fruit outside"; <em class="e000I2">Corallina</em> means "coral-like";
<em class="e000I2">Grinnellia</em> is named for Mr. Henry Grinnell.</p>

<p>The specific names are commonly adjectives, but sometimes
they are nouns, and occasionally are the names of the botanists
who first described the plants, in which case the name terminates
in <em class="e000I2">-i</em> or <em class="e000I2">-ii</em>. The specific name always follows the generic name,
thus:</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Ectocarpus Hooperi</em>, a species of <em class="e000I2">Ectocarpus</em>, first described by
Mr. Hooper.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Grinnellia Americana</em>, a species, peculiar to America, of a genus
named for Mr. Grinnell.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Griffithsia corallina</em>, a species resembling coral, and belonging
to a genus named for Mrs. Griffiths.</p>

<p>With regard to the four subclasses mentioned above, it should
be said that algæ are strictly classified in accordance with their
methods of reproduction; but since allied species have, with few
exceptions, the same color, the classification by colors is generally
adopted as convenient and sufficiently precise.</p>

<p>Familiar, or, in technical language, "vulgar," names are very
generally given to land plants, and especially to flowers; but seaweeds
are less in sight than flowers are, and so, save in a few
instances, have not been named except by the man of science.
To remember the scientific names will not be found difficult, for
without effort or special pains to acquire the new vocabulary,
the names, like those of new personal friends, will insensibly
become fixed in the memory.</p>

<p>In the body of this work each of the groups (class, subclass,
order, etc.), in the classification of both animals and plants, is
indicated by a special kind of type. <a id="pg030"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg030]</span></p>

<h3 title="VIII. Distribution of Algæ">
<a id="VIII-distribution_of_algae"></a>VIII<br />
DISTRIBUTION OF ALGÆ</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<div class="inlinelist">
<p>The eastern coast of North America has been divided into four
sections, which correspond to the distribution of the algæ which are
characteristic of each section. The boundary-lines are not precise,
since some species of each section extend beyond the defined limits;
but arctic forms are not generally found south of Cape Cod, nor
can tropical varieties be expected north of Cape Hatteras. On the
intervening coast, however, there are some species common to both
sections. The divisions are:</p>
<ul><li>(1) Greenland to Cape Cod;</li>
<li>(2) Cape Cod to Cape Hatteras;</li>
<li>(3) Cape Hatteras to Cape Florida;</li>
<li>(4) the Florida Keys and the shores of the Gulf of Mexico.</li></ul></div>

<p>On the Pacific coast such distinct lines of demarcation do not
exist, there being no such natural barriers as are formed on the
eastern coast, first by Cape Cod, and, second, by the stretch of
sand-beach which extends from New York to Charleston, and
which divides sharply the climatic varieties.</p>

<p>The whole shore is again divided laterally into three distinct
belts, called the <em class="e000I2">littoral</em>, the <em class="e000I2">laminarian</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">coralline</em> zones.
The first or littoral zone covers the space between tide-marks.
Vegetable life in this zone is subjected first to exposure to the
sun and air, and even to desiccation, and then to entire submergence
at constantly recurring periods. The rockweeds (<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>),
which are so plentiful in this zone, are very gelatinous, nature
having apparently provided the gelatine to protect the cells of
the plant from the effects of the alternating extreme conditions.
<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Enteromorpha</em> predominate in this zone. <a id="pg031"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg031]</span></p>

<p>The laminarian zone extends from low-water mark to the depth
of fifteen fathoms. The <em class="e000I2">Laminariaceæ</em> and the beautiful red algæ
(<em class="e000I2">Florideæ</em>) grow here.</p>

<p>The third or coralline zone extends to the depth of about fifty
fathoms. The algæ of this zone, the nullipores, are incrusted
with a deposit of lime which gives them the appearance of corals;
and, singularly enough, the corals, which are animal forms,
simulate plant life.</p>

<p>Again, algæ have special habits and demand certain climates
and seasons for their growth. Algologists register the place
where a specimen is found, and in this way localities have been
pretty well determined. However, great exactness has not been
reached, and the collector is ever watchful to find an alga in
some undiscovered home within the given range. Although
algæ grow from extreme high-water mark to the depth of fifty
fathoms, almost every variety may be found on the beach, those
growing in deep water being frequently torn off and washed
ashore by the waves. The heaps of sea-wrack will often reward
one who examines them carefully for deep-water species. Seaweeds
are most abundant on rocky shores, particularly where
there are stratified rocks with crevices, which afford shelter from
the waves. Rock pools often contain beautiful varieties of the
more delicate species. Red algæ will sometimes be found on
the shady side of these pools. Sand-beaches are unfavorable
to the growth of seaweeds, but fronds which have been carried
long distances by the currents will frequently be found on such
shores. <a id="pg032"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg032]</span></p>

<h3 title="IX. Some Peculiar and Interesting Varieties of Algæ">
<a id="IX-some_peculiar_and_interesting_varieties_of_algae"></a>IX
<br />SOME PECULIAR AND INTERESTING VARIETIES OF ALGÆ</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The species of seaweeds that are known and classified are
said to number several thousands. These plants, which
have neither vessels for the conduction of fluids, nor fibers, consisting
simply of the first vegetable element, the cell, have, notwithstanding
this limitation, assumed a great variety of forms.
In size they vary from one one-thousandth of an inch in diameter,
the smallest green plants known, to those which exceed in length
the height of the tallest trees and form dense submarine forests,
which in places make comparatively deep water impassable for
boats. In texture they vary from a jelly-&#160;to a paper-&#160;and a
leather-like consistency. In color they have all the shades of
green, brown, and red.</p>

<h4 title="Diatoms And Other Minute Algæ">DIATOMS AND OTHER MINUTE ALGÆ</h4>

<p>Among the smallest algæ are diatoms. They are microscopic
in size, but exist everywhere in both salt and fresh water, and
are infinite in variety as well as in numbers. They have a silicious,
shell-like covering, which divides and subdivides in their
reproductive growth, forming varied shapes which are exceedingly
beautiful and interesting to examine under the microscope.
In vast numbers they float on the surface of the sea, and,
together with other minute free-floating organisms, form the
basis of food-supply for fishes. Their indestructible shells fall
to the bottom of the sea, forming large deposits, which in time
become fossilized. The city of Richmond, Virginia, is built upon <a id="pg033"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg033]</span>
a fossiliferous bed of diatoms, which measures twenty to eighty
feet in depth and several miles in length.</p>

<p>Associated with diatoms, in fresh water, are desmids, which
are green in color and resemble the diatoms except in having a
cartilaginous instead of a silicious covering. Another minute
organism, <em class="e000I2">Pyrocystis noctiluca</em>, is luminous and is said to produce
the beautiful phosphorescent effects seen in tropical seas. <em class="e000I2">Trichodesmium</em>
is a little alga which periodically occurs in great
numbers, giving the water a red appearance, as in the Red Sea,
which is said to derive its name from this circumstance.</p>

<h4 title="Red Snow">RED SNOW</h4>

<p>In the high latitudes of the arctic regions, also on snowy mountains
at altitudes where all vegetable life is supposed to be
extinguished, there sometimes appears a redness on the surface
of the snow, which in some cases extends for many miles. At a
certain place in Greenland the color was so vivid that an arctic
voyager named the locality the Crimson Bluffs.</p>

<p>The strangeness and almost sudden appearance of this color in
the snow have been so unaccountable to uninformed observers
that it has been ascribed by them to the falling of bloody snow
and has been regarded with superstition. The redness is caused
by the growth of one of the smallest of plants, the <em class="e000I2">Protococcus
nivalis</em>. It is a simple one-celled alga containing protoplasm
and endochrome (red coloring-matter). It grows by cell-division,
the cell dividing into four, eight, or sixteen parts on a quaternary
scale. Each part acquires a new covering while within the
mother cell, and when it emerges it is a complete individual
and ready to repeat the process. Only a few hours are required
for its growth and development; hence its increase is rapid, and
it requires but a little time to make itself manifest in those places
where the conditions are favorable to its existence.</p>

<h4 title="The Sargasso Sea">THE SARGASSO SEA</h4>

<p>When the voyager reaches a certain region of the North Atlantic,
called the Sargasso Sea, he sails into a vast undulating marine <a id="pg034"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg034]</span>
prairie. Farther than the eye can reach is spread a yellowish-brown
vegetation which covers the water as grass covers the
plain. Sometimes these weeds are so thick as to impede navigation,
and, seen from a little distance, seem substantial enough
to walk upon. At other times, according to seasons and conditions
of storm and wind, they are divided into strips or into
island-like masses, with spaces of clear water between. If the
sailor did not know the special conditions existing here he might
suppose he had come upon dangerous shallows; or were the
waters less turbulent he might dream that he was floating
among the water-weeds of an inland lake.</p>

<p>This vast acreage of vegetation, as large as the continent of
Europe, lying southwest of the Azores and extending between
the Canary and the Cape Verde Islands, was first reported by
Columbus, and takes its name from the floating plant of which it
is composed, the <em class="e000I2">Sargassum bacciferum</em>, a species of the order
<em class="e000I2">Fucaceæ</em>, commonly known as gulfweed. Columbus's sailors took
fright at the marvelous appearance and wished to turn back,
thinking they had reached the end of the navigable ocean. They
thought, if land were beyond, it was guarded by shoals, and that
the weeds concealed dangerous rocks. Columbus threw out two
hundred fathoms of line, but did not reach bottom, and continued
on his course for fifteen days before emerging into clear
water. From that day to this the Sargasso Sea has attracted the
attention of all navigators. It is especially interesting to scientists.
The physicist finds there the phenomenon of the ocean
currents holding in a vortex this immense mass of seaweed, the
zoölogist finds a great pasture in whose protecting shelter are
living and breeding countless numbers of marine animals, and
the botanist is puzzled because the source of this species of plant
is clouded with doubt.</p>

</div>

<p>According to one theory, the plants are dislodged by the tempests
from terrestrial beds and carried by the Gulf Stream into
the huge eddy; but since there does not exist enough of the
attached plants of this species to supply the vast accumulation,
another and more generally accepted theory is that the gulfweed
lives also a pelagic life and adapts itself to the conditions of the <a id="pg035"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg035]</span>
floating state, thus dispensing with the disk-like root, as it needs
no holdfasts, and propagating solely by lateral and axillary
ramification.</p>

<p>There are said to be one hundred and fifty species of <em class="e000I2">Sargassum</em>,
but <em class="e000I2">S. bacciferum</em> alone constitutes the beds of the Sargasso
Sea. The plant is the most highly differentiated of any seaweed,
in that it more nearly approaches the true leaf and stem, and is
described botanically as follows: Frond furnished with distinct,
stalked, nerveless leaves and simple, axillary, stalked air-vessels.
The integument is leathery, and the color brown of varying
shades. The most striking peculiarity is the abundance of
globular cells. These berry-like air-bladders give the plant buoyancy
enough to support the weight of its innumerable guests.
(<a href="#Plate-XVI">Plate XVI.</a>)</p>

<h4 title="The Laminariaceæ">THE LAMINARIACEÆ</h4>

<p>In the laminarian zone, described above, grow the <em class="e000I2">Laminariaceæ</em>,
an order of brown seaweeds, some of whose genera grow to
enormous size, and in some places form dense submarine forests.
Darwin speaks of the good service rendered by these plants to
vessels navigating stormy coasts, where often they act as natural
breakwaters, and again as buoys designating dangerous rocks
near the shore on which they grow. The seaweeds belonging to
this order, commonly known as oarweeds, tangle, devil's-apron,
and sea-colander, are frequently seen twelve to twenty feet in
length, and others are measured by fathoms. One of the giant
plants is <em class="e000I2">Nereocystis Lütkeana</em>, which occurs on the northwest
coast. It has a stalk, sometimes three hundred feet in length,
which bears on its extremity a barrel-&#160;or cask-shaped air-vessel,
six or seven feet long, from the surface of which a tuft of fifty
or more forked laminæ grows to a length of thirty or forty feet.
The stem which anchors this immense frond is so small that the
Aleutian Indians use it for fishing-lines. The sea-otter makes
his home on its huge air-vessel, and the plant is called by the
Russians the "sea-otters' cabbage."</p>

<p>But the longest of all known plants is the alga <em class="e000I2">Macrocystis</em>. Its
thin naked stem, the diameter of which seldom exceeds one quarter <a id="pg036"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg036]</span>
of an inch, is reported by one author to be seven hundred feet
in length, by another fifteen hundred feet. It is terminated by
a lamina fifty feet long, resembling a pinnatifid leaf, each leaflet
of which, at its point of division on the stem, expands into an
air-vessel as large as an egg. These air-vessels sustain the
immense frond which floats on the surface of the water, its leaflets
depending in a vertical position from the stem. <em class="e000I2">M. pyrifera</em>,
the only species, is found in the Southern oceans and on the
Pacific coast of North America.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Lessonia</em>, another genus, resembles a palm-tree. It grows
erect to a great height and has a stem like the bole of a tree.
It branches in a forking manner and has depending from its
branches laminæ two or three feet long. The large stems from
which the laminæ have been torn by the storms, and which have
been cast ashore on the Falkland Islands, as described by Sir
Joseph Hooker, resemble driftwood, as they lie in piles three or
four feet high and extending for many miles.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Agarum</em> and <em class="e000I2">Thalassiophyllum</em> are arctic genera, but they are
found within our limits, the former in the North Atlantic. It
has a simple but enormous leaf-like frond. The latter, which is
found on the North Pacific coast, has a compound frond. Both
are characterized by their fronds being perforated throughout
with holes, giving them the name of sea-colander. <a id="pg037"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg037]</span></p>

<h3 title="X. Uses of Algæ"><a id="X-uses_of_algae"></a>X<br />USES
 OF ALGÆ</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>Water covers two thirds of the surface of the earth, and
algæ, with a very few exceptions, constitute the whole
vegetation which exists in that enormous area. They have,
therefore, an important part to perform in the economy of
nature. Algæ do not, like land plants, derive their nourishment
from the soil to which they are attached, but from substances
held in solution by water. In their growth they effect changes
in the water analogous to those effected by land plants in the
air; that is, they change so-called impurities in the water into
materials essential to animal life. The function of plants is that
of transforming or manufacturing inorganic matter, which they
assimilate, into organic matter (such as starch, albumen, sugar),
which forms their own structure and which is the food essential
to animals. In this process, plants inhale carbonic acid gas
which animals breathe out, and exhale oxygen which animals
breathe in. Plants feed on mineral substances and furnish vegetable
food, thus keeping up the balance of life.</p>

<p>Fresh-water algæ have a like economic value. The green surface
on stagnant pools is a vegetable growth whose function is
to assimilate the matter which makes the pool offensive. A
submerged district soon becomes covered with scum, or minute
plants (<em class="e000I2">Sphæoplea annulina</em>), which grow with great rapidity, using
up the materials of the decaying vegetation, and in great measure
counteracting the ill effects, in the atmosphere, of such decay.
When the waters subside, the plants shrivel up and appear like
thin paper covering the ground. This ephemeral substance soon <a id="pg038"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg038]</span>
disappears, without giving evidence of its nature in dust or
gases, its body seeming to be a machine which transmutes, but
does not hold, the substances on which it grows.</p>

<p>Algæ, as has been said above, grow in definite zones, and each
zone has also a definite animal life which finds there its food.
Darwin says: "In all parts of the world a rocky and partially
protected shore perhaps supports in a given space a greater
number of individual animals than any other station." And
speaking of the <em class="e000I2">Laminariaceæ</em>, he adds: "I can only compare
these great aquatic forests of the southern hemisphere with the
terrestrial ones in the intertropical regions. Yet if in any
country a forest was destroyed I do not believe nearly so many
species of animals would perish as would here from the destruction
of the kelp." The same may be said of the Sargasso Sea,
where millions of living creatures make their home. In every
kind of marine fauna there are species which derive, if not the
whole, at least a part of their nourishment from the seaweeds.</p>

<p>The vegetation in the narrow boundary of the three zones is
palpably inadequate to supply the needs of the animal life which
exists in deeper waters. But over the broad area of the ocean
there exists a vast number of pelagic, free-floating algæ, which,
although microscopical in size, are almost infinite in numbers.
In illustration of this it has been estimated that, although they
are not especially numerous in the Sargasso Sea, yet if all the
seaweed there were gathered into one mass and the free-floating
algæ into another, the bulk of the latter would exceed that of the
former. The pelagic flora consists of <em class="e000I2">Diatomaceæ</em>, <em class="e000I2">Protococcaceæ</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Peridinieæ</em>, and others. Undoubtedly it is on these pastures that
fishes feed, as well as other organisms which in turn are food for
fishes.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Laminaria</em> constitute the kelp from which iodine is
obtained, and were at one time the source of the potash of commerce.
<em class="e000I2">Fucus vesiculosus</em> is a constituent of a medicine used as a
cure for obesity. <em class="e000I2">Chondrus crispus</em>, commonly known as Irish
moss, was a few years ago generally used as an article of diet.
<em class="e000I2">Porphyra vulgaris</em> (laver) is used by the Chinese for soups. <em class="e000I2">Rhodymenia
palmata</em> (dulse) is an article of food in Ireland and Scotland. <a id="pg039"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg039]</span>
<em class="e000I2">Gracilaria spinosa</em> is used by birds, allied to the swallows,
for making their nests—the edible nests found in large numbers
on the islands of the Indian Archipelago, especially in the caves
on the shores of Java, and gathered and sent to China, where
they bring large prices and are used in making the famous birds'-nest
soup. <em class="e000I2">Gracilaria lichenoides</em>, also a species of the Eastern seas,
is the source of agar-agar, a preparation used in laboratories as a
culture-medium for bacteria. Fossil diatoms are ground and
used for polishing-powders. Seaweeds are everywhere used by
farmers on the coasts as fertilizers. <a id="pg040"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg040]</span></p>

COLLECTING AT BAR HARBOR</h3>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The beautiful coast of Maine is a particularly good field for
shore-collecting. The rocky coast harbors the boreal fauna
and flora which depend upon such physical conditions, and the
shores at Bar Harbor are typical of those found elsewhere in
northern New England. The rocks give shelter from the beating
surf, while life has exposure to the cold, pure waters of the arctic
current. Everywhere along the shore, rock pools are to be found.
These are perhaps the most fascinating of all spots to the collector.
They are veritable gardens of the sea, where species
flourish which naturally belong to deeper water, but which find
in such pools conditions suitable to their existence.</p>

<p>At Bar Harbor one well-known and frequently visited rock
pool is found in Anemone Cave. Entering a field at Schooner
Head, one turns to the right and follows the rocky shore for two
or three hundred feet. It is difficult to take this short walk
without being constantly diverted and delayed by the various
attractions one meets, such as the tide-pools, the barnacles which
in places whiten the rocks, the periwinkles, the purpura shells,
and the curious algæ; but at last one arrives at a cavern under
an overhanging rock. Here is a large tide-pool which at first
sight displays only a beautiful scheme of color. It is carpeted
with a bright-pink alga, <em class="e000I2">Hildenbrandtia rosea</em>, which incrusts the
basin of the pool.</p>

<p>Interspersed with the pink are patches of a deep-red color,
having a velvety appearance, which are formed by another crustaceous
alga, <em class="e000I2">Petrocelis cruenta</em>. The water of the pool is of crystal <a id="pg041"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg041]</span>
clearness, and as one gazes into it one object after another
comes into view, until one is filled with astonishment at the number
of beautiful objects the pool contains. The little green balls,
one half of an inch to one inch in diameter, which look like small
green tomatoes scattered on the stones, are <em class="e000I2">Leathesia difformis</em>, an
alga which cannot be mistaken for any other. Bunches of <em class="e000I2">Corallina
officinalis</em>, which resembles coral, as the name indicates, are abundant.
This alga should be examined with a magnifying-glass.
It is covered with calcareous matter, and its peculiar form of
growth is beautiful and interesting.</p>

<p>The fronds of the laminarian <em class="e000I2">Alaria esculenta</em> are tiny here,
while just outside the cave they are to be seen several feet in
length, beating against the rocks in the swash of the waves.
Thorny sea-urchins (<em class="e000I2">Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis</em>) make green
spots which look like tufts of moss. Yellow and green sponges
in little cones are spread over small surfaces. Starfishes and
ophiurans are plentiful. The <em class="e000I2">Purpura lapillus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Littorina litorea</em>
and <em class="e000I2">rudis</em> (periwinkles), so plentiful on this coast, are present.
The <em class="e000I2">Mytillus</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Saxicava</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Acmæa testudinalis</em> are also
to be found. A green crab (<em class="e000I2">Carcinus mænas</em>) is snugly hidden in
a dark nook on the shady side of the pool, and many small crustaceans
scuttle away from under stones as they are lifted. The
collector is always anxious for uncommon, or rather less plentiful,
species, and here are found two specimens of nudibranchs,
or naked mollusks, <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em> and <em class="e000I2">Dendronotus</em>. The <em class="e000I2">Chiton ruber</em>, a
jointed mollusk, was also found here, and five species of sea-anemones
were counted. As this is a favorite hunting-ground,
the anemones have not been left to attain full growth; but there
are very many small ones which at first are not distinguishable, as
they retract their tentacles at the slightest disturbance of the water
and are then quite inconspicuous. After a little time of quiet
watching they will be seen putting out their tentacles and expanding
their beautiful flower-like forms. It is useless to try to capture
them uninjured, so tightly do they adhere to the rocks, and
the difficulty of preserving them in an expanded form is so great
that amateur collectors had better leave them undisturbed to
beautify the pool. <a id="pg042"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg042]</span></p>

<p>It was hard to resist robbing this rock pool, where the author
in half an hour counted twenty different species, and finally left,
feeling that its treasures were not half discovered; but collecting
should be done elsewhere, and this pool be guarded as a gem to
be admired and not to be despoiled.</p>

<p>This pool in Anemone Cave, although so very attractive, is
surpassed in beauty and interest by pools on Porcupine Island,
at the base of the cliff. This place is somewhat difficult of access,
and the timid will not undertake the descent to it; but the enthusiastic
collector, who overlooks small obstacles, will be repaid
by a visit to this spot, where all the treasures of Anemone Cave
are multiplied many times over. These pools are resplendent with
large anemones, hydroids, nudibranchs, mollusks, echinoderms,
crustaceans, and algæ. <em class="e000I2">Alaria esculenta</em>, several feet in length,
is beaten to a fringe against the rocks, and <em class="e000I2">Agarum Turneri</em>, the
sea-colander, is also found here, together with beautiful specimens
of <em class="e000I2">Rhodymenia palmata</em>, which is so plentiful that it reddens
the rocks.</p>

<p>A <em class="e000I2">Metridium marginatum</em>, the most common sea-anemone of
this coast, was taken here which measured six inches in diameter.
This creature threw out so many of the processes used for defense
that it seemed at first as though it were covered with some
seaweed; but the worm-like movements of these threads, which
measured six inches or more in length, soon disclosed their nature.</p>

<p>On the more accessible shores of Porcupine Island are found
the naked mollusks (nudibranchs) <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em> and <em class="e000I2">Dendronotus</em>. Clinging
sideways to the rocks just above high-water mark are many
shells of <em class="e000I2">Littorina rudis</em>. They are fastened to the rocks by a
glutinous deposit along the outer lip, and the peculiar exposure
of the open end, as well as the position above tide-mark, indicates
that this animal is undergoing transformation into a land
species. <em class="e000I2">Littorina palliata</em> is abundant on the rockweeds (<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>);
some of the specimens are banded with yellow, and all closely
simulate the seaweed on which they cling. Beautifully banded
specimens of <em class="e000I2">Littorina litorea</em> are also plentiful. Among other
shells which are abundant here as well as elsewhere on this coast
are <em class="e000I2">Purpura lapillus</em>, <em class="e000I2">Acmæa testudinalis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Buccinum undatum</em>, <em class="e000I2">Mya
arenaria</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Mytillus edulis</em>. <a id="pg043"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg043]</span></p>

<p>Under the rockweeds in small pools and crevices are the polyzoans
<em class="e000I2">Bugula turrita</em> and <em class="e000I2">Membranipora pilosa</em>, and the hydroids
<em class="e000I2">Sertularia pumila</em> and <em class="e000I2">S. argentea</em>.</p>

<p>The seaweeds <em class="e000I2">Rhodymenia palmata</em> (dulse) and <em class="e000I2">Desmarestia</em> are
plentiful; also beautiful worms, crustaceans, and starfishes.</p>

<p>A very interesting beach is found a few hundred feet south of
Otter Cliffs, to which an easy descent is made if one follows a
pathway leading to it through a grove adjacent to the drive.
Here one will be interested in the study of numerous and beautiful
rock pools.</p>

<p>Sea-urchins (<em class="e000I2">Strongylocentrotus drobachiensis</em>) seem to carpet
some of them, having the appearance of mossy tufts. Beautiful
pink and purple starfishes (<em class="e000I2">Asterias vulgaris</em>), brittle-stars (<em class="e000I2">Ophiopholis
aculeata</em>), sea-cucumbers (<em class="e000I2">Pentacta frondosa</em>), sea-anemones,
and crabs are abundant. If one lifts a stone the little crustaceans
<em class="e000I2">Orchestia</em> and <em class="e000I2">Gammarus</em> will hurry away, and very likely
an interesting worm or a nudibranch will be found. It is also
most interesting to watch the barnacles, which are below the
surface, reaching out their curled, feather-like feet in regular
rhythmic grasping motions. The common mussels (<em class="e000I2">Mytillus edulis</em>),
which in places blacken the shore, are beautiful under
examination, and the silky network or byssus which forms the
anchorage should be observed.</p>

<p>The rocks are hung so plentifully with <em class="e000I2">Ascophyllum nodosum</em>
(rockweed) that its beauty is likely to be passed over unnoticed.
On the <em class="e000I2">Ascophyllum</em> is growing in tufts <em class="e000I2">Polysiphonia fastigiata</em>;
other seaweeds, <em class="e000I2">Rhodymenia palmata</em>, <em class="e000I2">Chordaria flagelliformis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Desmarestia
aculeata</em>, <em class="e000I2">Corallina officinalis</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Ceramium</em>, are so
abundant that one forgets to value them at the moment. Higher
up on the beach the rocks are spotted with papery sheets, which,
floated out in water, prove to be the beautiful purple <em class="e000I2">Porphyra</em>. A
fine, dark colored, hairy scum on the rocks is <em class="e000I2">Bangia fusco-purpurea</em>.
Sometimes one finds here fronds of <em class="e000I2">Laminaria</em> which have been
washed ashore. Various green algæ are abundant. Even if not
collecting, it is well to carry a small tin pail to the beach and
float out pieces of the algæ in order to observe carefully, if but
for a moment, the beautiful forms they have in their natural state.
Watched for a few minutes in a pail of water animals disclose curious <a id="pg044"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg044]</span>
and surprising forms and habits which are difficult to watch
leaning over a pool.</p>

<p>Most of the various species mentioned above are common
along the whole shore, and may be looked for at almost any
point where the water is free from contamination.</p>

<p>At the sand-beach are found species which do not inhabit the
rocky shore, as the sand-dollar (<em class="e000I2">Echinarachnius parma</em>), <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em>
(<em class="e000I2">Lunatia</em>) <em class="e000I2">heros</em>, <em class="e000I2">Mya arenaria</em>, and others. After a storm various
deep-water forms are washed upon this beach. <em class="e000I2">Laminaria digitata</em>,
six feet long, is found here sometimes under these circumstances.
<em class="e000I2">Chordaria flagelliformis</em>, resembling long switches of hair, floats
from the rocks near the shore. To the left, on the rock under
the overhanging ledge, is a tide-pool which one would hesitate
to deface by touching a single specimen. So crystal-clear is
the water, so brilliant the <em class="e000I2">Hildenbrandtia</em>, so lovely the <em class="e000I2">Corallina</em>,
that all seem placed there to excite admiration.</p>

<p>But most of all one should obtain the permission of the owner
to visit Rodicks Weir. Here is an immense natural aquarium,
full of living wonders. On a clear day, sunlight penetrates to
the bottom, and at low tide the whole contents of the weir are
clearly seen as one floats through the inclosed water-spaces.
On the bottom are sea-urchins, many of them with sticks or
stones on their backs, which the animals have placed there in
the endeavor to conceal themselves; starfishes feeding; and
great numbers of whelks (<em class="e000I2">Buccinum undatum</em>). Cuttlefishes dart
rapidly about, and skates, sculpins, and other fishes display their
curious forms. Very likely a giant jellyfish (<em class="e000I2">Cyanea arctica</em>) is
entangled in the brush, so that one can examine at short range
its wonderful and beautiful parts. Other jellyfishes may be
closely scrutinized.</p>

<p>The alga <em class="e000I2">Polysiphonia violacea</em> floats in long feathery tufts
from the stakes.</p>

<p>On the eel-grass are to be found <em class="e000I2">Lacuna vincta</em> and the delicate
iridescent little shells of <em class="e000I2">Margarita helicina</em>.</p>

<p>Every tide brings different species of the ocean fauna to temporary
imprisonment in this inclosure, so that it is difficult to
say what one may not chance to find in this interesting place.</p>

<p>The minute algæ, which form patches of purple color on
rocks, slimy layers or spots on wharves, bluish-green slime
on mud, emerald-green films on decaying algæ, blue-green
slime on brackish ditches, and so on, are various species of the
subclass <em class="eB0002">Cyanophyceæ</em>. The prevailing color of these plants is
blue-green, but some are purple, brown, or pink. Some of them
are gelatinous in texture and shapeless, others have more definite
forms; but all are too small to classify without the aid of a powerful
glass, and are not of special interest except to the botanist.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genera</em> <em class="eB00I2">Oscillaria</em> and <em class="eB00I2">Spirulina</em></p>

<p>The genus <em class="eB00I2">Oscillaria</em> is so named from an oscillating movement
which these filamentous plants show when viewed under
the microscope. They are very delicate blue-green threads occurring
singly, or in loose or felt-like floating masses, or like slime
or scum, on mud or woodwork. In <em class="eB00I2">Spirulina</em> the filaments are
spirally twisted like a corkscrew and also have a vibrating movement.
<em class="e000I2">Spirulina</em> is often found growing with <em class="e000I2">Oscillaria</em>, and
forms purple patches on wharves.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Calothrix</em><span class="smaller">
("<em class="e000I2">Beautiful hair</em>")</span></p>

<p>Filaments one tenth of an inch long, terminating in transparent
hair-like points, occasionally branching. The plant grows in fine
tufts or like a fringe on algæ or in patches on rocks. Sometimes
it forms a spongy layer, again a velvety stratum. The color
varies in different species; it may be bright green, brownish-green, <a id="pg050"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg050]</span>
or dark bluish-purple. The genus is very common, and
the plants are often found on the bottoms of boats.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. majuscula</em>, mermaid's-hair. The filaments are curled or crisped,

found floating free. It is common in summer everywhere south of Cape
Cod and on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. ferruginea</em> or <em class="eB00I2">æstuarii</em>. In this species the filaments are thin,
soft, and without stability (flaccid), so that they lie flat like a thin
stratum. They are verdigris-green in color, and are found in brackish
pools and ditches and on muddy shores near the sea. <a id="pg051"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg051]</span></p></div>

<p>"There can hardly be a more fascinating group of plants than
this, whether to the strictly scientific botanist or to the more
catholic lover of nature. The green algæ are among the most widely
diffused of plant forms. They grow practically in every place where
enough moisture, together with light and air, is to be had. Between
tide-marks on almost every coast, floating on the surface of the deep
sea, covering damp earth, walls, palings, and tree-trunks, sticking
to the surface of leaves in the moist atmosphere of tropical forests
and jungles, and inhabiting almost every river, brook, pond, ditch,
or casual pool of rain-water in all quarters of the globe, are
members of this ubiquitous group to be found."<a id="FNanchor_3_3"
href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<div class="footnote">
<a id="Footnote_3_3" href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span
 class="label">[3]</span></a> Kerner.
</div>

<p>The grass-green seaweeds are more simple in structure, and
therefore are lower in order, than the red or brown algæ. They
are among the lowest of all plants, many of them being minute
single cells. They abound in fresh as well as in salt water, and
in this respect differ from the other groups, the red and the brown
algæ being almost exclusively marine plants.</p>

<p>As one approaches the shore, the attention is often attracted
by the green mantle which covers everything overflowed by the
tides. This consists largely of the confervoid algæ, which are
very abundant and are found almost everywhere. They are
dense tufts of fine thread-like plants, often matted at the base;
sometimes they are sponge-like, floating masses.</p>

<p>The <em class="eB0002">Ulvaceæ</em>, the plants next higher in order, are the first
which assume ribbon-&#160;and leaf-like expansions, and usually first
engage the attention of the collector. <a id="pg053"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg053]</span></p>

<p>In the green algæ are found the extreme forms of one-celled
plants. In <em class="eB00I2">Pleurococcus</em> the cell is microscopic in size. In the
<em class="eB0002">Siphoneæ</em> the plant still consists of a single cell, but it attains
large dimensions and develops into forms resembling, in outward
appearance, leaf, stem, and root (see <em class="e000I2">Caulerpa</em>).</p>

<p>Other plants consist of single rows of cells, called filaments
(<em class="eB0002">Confervaceæ</em>), or of cells arranged in layers or flat surfaces, called
membranes (<em class="eB0002">Ulvaceæ</em>).</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">CONFERVACEÆ</em></h5>

<p>The silkweeds. This order is characterized by cylindrical cells
strung end to end, forming threads or filaments, branched and
unbranched. The plants inhabit both fresh and salt water, and
are very abundant and widely distributed. They grow in dense
tufts, often matted at the base.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Ulothrix</em></p>

<p>A yellow-green, unbranched, decumbent, soft, hair-like fleece
on the surface of rocks, extending indefinitely. This genus differs
from <em class="e000I2">Chætomorpha</em> in the character of its filaments, which
are soft and gelatinous in <em class="eB00I2">Ulothrix</em>, but bristle-like and wiry in
<em class="e000I2">Chætomorpha</em>.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Chætomorpha</em></p>

<p>The frond is filiform; the filaments are coarse, rigid, and
unbranched. In some species the filaments grow straight and in
tufts from a definite base; in others they are twisted together
and are prostrate. Often they are found floating in masses. In
<em class="eB00I2">C. tortuosa</em> the filaments are as fine as human hair, but rigid, and
so closely interwoven as to resemble a layer of wool on the rocks.
The cell-divisions give a striped appearance to the filaments when
dry.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. melagonium.</em> This species is dark green, with filaments erect,
coarse as a double bristle, and wiry; five to twelve inches long. It is
found in rock pools from Boston northward. It does not adhere to
paper in drying, and loses its color if immersed in fresh water.
(<a href="#Plate-III">Plate III.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. ærea.</em> Yellowish-green, with filaments erect and less rigid than <a id="pg054"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg054]</span>
in <em class="e000I2">C. melagonium</em>, which it otherwise resembles; tufts three to twelve
inches long; cell-divisions very marked. This species is found in rock
pools from Cape Cod to New York Bay.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. linum.</em> Bright green; filaments coarse, rigid, twisted together,
and prostrate. It is found floating in masses and forming strata on
rocks and gravel from New York northward. It is thought by some
that this, as well as <em class="eB00I2">C. picquotiana</em>, which it closely resembles, is not
a true species, but consists of the mature plants of the species <em class="e000I2">C. melagonium</em>
and <em class="e000I2">C. ærea</em>, which have become detached from their holdfasts
and have continued to grow. (<a href="#Plate-III">Plate III.</a>)</p></div>

("<em class="e000I2">Branch-bearing</em>")</span></p>

<p>Frond filiform, branched. There are many species of <em class="eB00I2">Cladophora</em>,
which differ from one another in their branching, color,
and size. They abound on rocks at low-water mark, in tide-pools,
in muddy ditches, and on wharves. They are especially
characterized by being so profusely branched as to form tufts or
spherical masses, by which the collector can easily distinguish the
genus.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. arcta.</em> Bright, glossy green; filaments fine, erect, much branched,
two to eight inches long; tufts dense, more or less entangled, and in
bunches, giving a starry effect. The species is common on rocks near
low-water mark from New York northward. The plants vary slightly
in appearance with the season. (<a href="#Plate-III">Plate III.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. rupestris.</em> Dark green; filaments straight, rigid, tufted; branches
crowded; many branchlets flattened against the filaments, so that the
alga somewhat resembles grass; five to ten inches long. The cell-divisions
show plainly. Plants of this species do not adhere to paper
in drying. They are found on rocks at low-water mark, and are common
on the northern New England coast. (<a href="#Plate-III">Plate III.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. gracilis.</em> Bright yellow-green; filaments very fine, loosely tufted,
three to twelve inches long, soft, silky, much branched; branches rather
short, and branchlets more or less curved and arranged in a comb-like
manner. It grows on wharves, in muddy pools, and on eel-grass.

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">ULVACEÆ</em></h5>

<p>The plants of this order are, with few exceptions, formed of
celled surfaces and show the earliest type of an expanded leaf.
The cells form thin membranes, which sometimes are broad surfaces
of no definite shape, sometimes are narrow and ribbon-like,
or they may be simple or branched tubes. When the membrane
<a id="pg055"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg055]</span> consists of a single layer of cells it is <em class="eB00I2">Monostroma</em> ("one
layer"); when it consists of a double layer it is <em class="eB00I2">Ulva</em>; when the
layers separate, the thallus becomes hollow, and it is then <em class="eB00I2">Enteromorpha</em>.
These plants are mostly a brilliant grass-green
in color, are silky in texture, and are attached by a small disk to
rocks and stones. They abound everywhere, and are commonly
known as <em class="e000I2">green laver</em>.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Ulva</em></p>

<p>Frond a thin, silky, flat membrane, sometimes leaf-like, again an
extended surface of no definite shape. These are the largest
green algæ. They are common everywhere.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">U. lactuca</em>, the sea-lettuce. Frond a flat membrane of various shapes,
sometimes orbicular, again deeply incised, often ribbon-like; margin
always much waved or ruffled. In the variety <em class="eB00I2">rigida</em> the frond is oval
in outline, not very large, and quite firm or rigid. The species is found
on rocks exposed to the action of the waves.
(<a href="#Plate-IV">Plate IV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">U. latissima.</em> Frond a flat, expanded membrane of indefinite shape,
but general outline oval, never ribbon-like; attains a size of twelve to
twenty-four inches; often deeply lobed, very waved, often perforated
with holes; membrane brilliant green, thin, smooth, glossy. It grows
apart or in tufts, and is found everywhere, in all stages of growth. It
is the largest species of <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em>, and is very common on muddy shores.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Enteromorpha</em></p>

<p>Fronds tubular, simple or branched, sometimes inflated. The
tubes vary in size in different species and also in the same species,
some being fine like a hair, others large, and flat or inflated.
The genus is widely distributed and very abundant. Species of
<em class="eB00I2">Enteromorpha</em> grow on the bottoms of ships, and in nautical
language are called <em class="e000I2">grass</em>.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. clathrata.</em> Fronds thread-like, tubular, branched, and branches
beset with numerous fine branchlets; densely tufted, soft. Common
everywhere. (<a href="#Plate-IV">Plate IV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. compressa.</em> Fronds long, slender, branched, tufted; branches
simple, compressed, extending from main central branch, obtuse at ends,
but attenuated at base. The species is very abundant everywhere, and
is a useful plant for the aquarium. (<a href="#Plate-V">Plate V.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. intestinalis.</em> Single, long, inflated tubes or sacs, obtuse at the
apex, very attenuated at the base; fronds often crimped and twisted,
resembling an intestine, whence the name. (<a href="#Plate-V">Plate V.</a>) <a id="pg056"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg056]</span></p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. lanceolata.</em> Formerly called <em class="e000I2">Ulva Linza</em>. Frond narrow, ribbon-like,
six to twelve inches long, one inch to two inches wide; blunt or
pointed at apex, tapering at base; attached by a disk; edges much
ruffled; bright green, soft, thin.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Monostroma</em></p>

<p>This genus resembles <em class="e000I2">Ulva</em>, but is more delicate since it has
but one layer of cells, as its name implies. The frond is usually
sac-like at first, then breaks apart, leaving a thin, semi-transparent
membrane of no definite shape.</p>

<h5>GROUP <em class="eBU001">SIPHONEÆ</em></h5>

<p>The distinct and peculiar character of this group is that in each
individual the whole plant consists of but one cell. There are
many genera, some of which are plants of elaborate form and
considerable size, but always the one cell expands and branches
without dividing the elongated cavity with septa, or plates of
division. In <em class="eB00I2">Caulerpa</em> the stability of the plant is secured by
numerous fibrils which emanate from the interior of the cell,
forming a spongy network of interlacing filaments. In other
orders the branches gain support from incrustation, from interlacing,
and from cohering on the edges.</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">VALONIACEÆ</em></h6>

<p>The algæ of this order are found only in tropical or subtropical
waters. Their holdfasts resemble fibrous roots and penetrate the
sand or coral on which they grow.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Chamædoris</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. annulata.</em> When young this alga consists of an annulated tube
formed of a single cell. The annular constrictions occur at short intervals,
giving it the appearance of being jointed. It grows to the height
of two to three inches, when it ceases to lengthen and produces a dense
mass of filaments, forming a head or spherical tuft one inch or more in
diameter. It is bright grass-green in color, rather rigid and tough, and
when mature is thinly coated with carbonate of lime. The holdfast is a
tuft of fibers. The species is found at Key West and is a native of the
West Indies.</p></div>

<h4 title="Olive-green And Brown Seaweeds"><a id="pg064"></a>OLIVE-GREEN AND BROWN SEAWEEDS</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>This subclass contains some of the most remarkable of the
seaweeds. It is especially notable for the diversity of its plant
forms, which range from filaments to plants which appear to have
stems and leaves (<em class="e000I2">Sargassum</em>). The species vary in size from very
small fronds to those of immense size (the <em class="e000I2">Laminariaceæ</em>). It includes
<em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> (the rockweeds), a very conspicuous genus, which
furnishes fully three fourths of the vegetable covering of the
tidal rocks in the localities in which it grows.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">ECTOCARPACEÆ</em></h5>

<p>This order comprises many species of branched, filamentous
plants, some of which are of hair-like fineness and form beautiful
feathery tufts of brownish or olive-green color. They resemble,
except in their tawny color, the green alga <em class="e000I2">Cladophora</em>.</p>

<p>The name is derived from Greek words meaning "outside"
and "fruit," the spores of the plants being borne on the branches.</p>

<p>The species are determined by the arrangement of the spores,
according as they are in the pod-like branches, in groups, or in
cases on stalks. Since these differences are not perceptible to
the naked eye, it is impracticable to describe many species, or for
the amateur collector to try to separate them.</p>

and expanded leaf-like laminæ. They are leather-like, not
articulated, olive-green or brown in color, and sometimes yellow
and semi-transparent. They grow in deep water and are found
washed ashore. Sometimes small plants are found in deep tide-pools
at low-water mark. Some species are perennial. In these
instances the stems only survive, and the laminæ are reproduced
annually. The new growth takes place at the apex of the
stem. The old lamina is pushed off, but is held on the summit
of the new growth until the latter has matured.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. longicruris</em> ("long-stalked"). Stem six to twelve feet long, one
to two inches thick, slender and solid at base, hollow and inflated at the
middle, contracted at the top; attached by a strong, branching, root-like
holdfast; color light brown. The large, single, leaf-like lamina, usually
shorter than the stem, is five to twenty feet long, two to three feet broad,
with much waved and folded margin, outlined with two rows of depressed
spots. The spores form a band in the center of the blade. Found from
Cape Cod northward and on the Pacific coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. saccharina</em>, the sea-tangle. This species differs from <em class="e000I2">L. longicruris</em>
in having a short, solid stem and narrow, ribbon-like lamina. Stem three
inches to four feet long; lamina three to thirty feet long, six to eighteen
inches wide, with central band of depressed spots; margin much waved;
color olive-green, semi-transparent. It is named from the saccharine
matter, called <em class="e000I2">mannite</em>, which it contains. Found on northern shores of
the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans. (<a href="#Plate-XII">Plate XII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. digitata</em> ("fingered"). Stem one to five feet long, thick, round,
and solid; lamina oval at base, leathery, smooth, brown, deeply cleft
into segments of unequal breadth. It is named from the hand-like form
of the lamina. This species is found in Long Island Sound, but is not
common south of Cape Cod. The stem is used by fishermen for knife-handles.
Pieces of it, placed on the blades while green, contract in drying
and become solid. (<a href="#Plate-XIII">Plate XIII.</a>)</p></div>

wide and two to twenty feet long, branching dichotomously (or by
forking), and dotted with pits, or conceptacles, in which the spores are

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Fucus</em></p>

<p>The rockweeds. The plants of this genus grow in thick
bunches, and are found in great abundance between tide-marks.
The plants are attached by sucker-like disks to the rocks, from
which they hang like fringe when the tide recedes; when it
rises they float and sway in the water in beautiful bouquet-like
forms. In color they are brown or olive-green, in texture thick
and leathery, but they sometimes expand into thin membranes.
They are many times forked in the same plane, which produces a
flat thallus. They often have a distinct midrib. The air-vessels,
whose function it is to float the plant, are disposed along the
midrib, usually in pairs.</p>

<p>The species are named according to the divisions of the frond,
and the disposition, or presence, of the air-bladders and the
<em class="e000I2">conceptacles</em>, or spore-chambers.</p>

<p>The conceptacles congregate in particular portions of the frond
and give its surface a roughness which is very perceptible; such
portions are then known as the <em class="e000I2">receptacles</em>. In <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> this
usually occurs on the bulbous extremities of the branches.
Under the microscope a section of one of these little pointed
spots shows a spherical cavity filled with a beautiful arrangement
of <em class="e000I2">paraphyses</em>, or threads, some of which hold spores, while
others protrude through a small opening in the outer membrane.
Conceptacles are peculiar to the order <em class="eB0002">Fucaceæ</em>. In them
spore-production is carried on in a manner as complicated as is
the formation of seeds in flowering plants. Although rockweeds
are such a conspicuous feature of sea-shore vegetation, two species
only, <em class="e000I2">Fucus vesiculosus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Ascophyllum nodosum</em> (formerly called
<em class="e000I2">Fucus nodosus</em>), are common on the Atlantic coast, and these do
not occur south of New York, owing to the fact that a long
stretch of sand-beach extends beyond that point.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. vesiculosus.</em> Midrib distinct through all the forked branches;
margin entire, often wavy; air-vessels spherical or oblong, usually in
pairs along the midrib; receptacles on terminal branches, which are
swollen and filled with gelatinous matter, heart-shaped or forked, in
oblong or pointed divisions; frond tough and leathery, often two feet
long. (<a href="#Plate-XIV">Plate XIV.</a>)</p></div>

leaf, resembling in outward appearance the higher plants. It <a id="pg074"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg074]</span>
is a tropical and subtropical genus, and has one hundred and
fifty species. Two of these, <em class="e000I2">S. vulgare</em> and <em class="e000I2">S. Montagnei</em>, are found
as far north as Cape Cod. See Introduction, <a href="#pg034">page 34</a>.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. vulgare.</em> Stems cylindrical; branches alternate; leaves long,
narrow, toothed, with short stalk and midrib; minute dark spots on its
surface; air-vessels small balls resembling berries set on stalks and
usually tipped with a long point; receptacles small, twig-like forms
in the axils of the leaves; color olive-brown; plant one foot to three
or more feet long. Common in Long Island Sound. (<a href="#Plate-XVI">Plate XVI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. Montagnei.</em> This species resembles <em class="e000I2">S. vulgare</em>, but is more slender
in all its parts, and the receptacles are more elongated. From south of
Cape Cod.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. bacciferum.</em> Particular interest attaches to this species from the
fact that it is the one which forms the floating vegetation of the Sargasso
Sea. It grows attached on the Florida Keys and in the West Indies.
Specimens are sometimes carried by the currents northward, and are
found washed ashore. It differs from <em class="e000I2">S. vulgare</em> in the leaves, which
are thicker, more attenuated, and sharply toothed, and in having a
greater number of air-vessels. A branch of this species brought from
the Sargasso Sea had air-vessels so numerous and closely set that it
resembled a bunch of small grapes.</p></div>

<p>In <em class="eB0002">Rhodophyceæ</em>, known also as <em class="eB0002">Florideæ</em> and <em class="eB0002">Rhodospermeæ</em>,
algæ attain their highest development. This is marked by
the mode of reproduction, which, more nearly than in the other
subclasses, resembles that of flowering plants. The fronds, however,
are not as large and do not as closely resemble stem and leaf
as do some species of the brown algæ.</p>

<p>The species of this subclass are very numerous, and the variety
in their fronds, their delicate texture, and their colors, which vary
from pink to purple, make them the most attractive of the seaweeds.
They grow mostly in deep water, but are often found
washed ashore, and many grow just below low-water mark and
on the shady side of tide-pools.</p>

<p>In the simplest species the frond consists of branched cell-rows.
In some of these the filaments are so fine that a pocket-lens is required
to determine the differences in branching and fully to
appreciate the beauty of the plant (<em class="e000I2">Callithamnion</em>). Some have a
cell-surface. In <em class="e000I2">Delesseria</em> the membrane assumes the outline of
a foliage-leaf. <em class="e000I2">Dasya</em>, which is an abundant variety, is especially
beautiful in its feather-like appearance. The corallines are singular
in that they are incrusted with lime and resemble corals.</p>

<p>The genera included in this suborder are easily distinguished
when in fruit by the spore-cases, or cystocarps, which appear <a id="pg087"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg087]</span>
like little balls, either adherent to the branches, or raised on short
stalks. It is the largest group, and contains many of the most
beautiful of the red algæ.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Polysiphonia</em> <span class="smaller">("<em class="e000I2">Many
tubes</em>")</span></p>

<p>A filament of <em class="eB00I2">Polysiphonia</em> appears, when seen under the microscope,
like a bundle of filaments made up of a central tube, or
axis, surrounded by a number of other tubes. It is by the number
of these parts, called siphons, which vary in number from four
to twenty, that the species is determined. In some plants the
siphons are surrounded by a layer of cells, called corticating or
bark cells, which give the filaments a solid, uniform appearance.
In others the siphons are naked, and the filaments then seem
striped or banded with color. It is difficult, without a microscope,
to be sure of the classification. There are, however, other
characteristics which separate many of the species, and some of
these are described below. Two hundred species of <em class="e000I2">Polysiphonia</em>
have been named by algologists. The plants are plentiful on all
shores, especially in warm, shallow waters. Some species are perennial,
but most of them are annuals and disappear in winter.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. fastigiata.</em> This species grows on <em class="e000I2">Ascophyllum nodosum</em> in a
globular tuft, and appears like a dark-brown ball, one inch to three
inches in diameter. The frond is a dense mass of rigid filaments branching
many times in a forking manner and at broad angles. The ends are
of nearly equal length, giving the plant a spherical shape. It is common
from New York northward at all seasons, and is easily recognized by its
general form and place of growth. Egg-shaped cystocarps, or spore-cases,
occur in the ends of the terminal filaments. (<a href="#Plate-XXV">Plate XXV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. nigrescens.</em> Frond three to twelve inches long, rigid below, soft

from edges of the flat stems; main branches wide-spreading and irregularly
placed, secondary branches regular and alternate; branchlets one eighth
to one half of an inch long, covered on the edges and around the top
with incurved ramuli; branchlets broken off near the base of the
branches in mature plants; branchlets usually uniform in length, but
occasionally one is longer and branches like the primary stem; color
black. Common on the California coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. Harveyi.</em> Frond two to six inches high; grows in globose tufts,

main stem quickly lost in a number of prominent stems and spreading
branches; irregularly and profusely branched, becoming ultimately very
fine; numerous branchlets covered with colorless fibrils in hairy tufts,
which give it a misty appearance; fibrils so delicate that they do not
show well in dried specimens, but a distinct feature by which to recognize
the species in the young plant; color light to dark brown; cystocarps
adherent to branchlets or on short stalks; siphons four in number;
main branches only corticated. It is common in summer on stones and
on eel-grass, at low-water mark, from Cape Cod to New York. (<a href="#Plate-XXVII">Plate XXVII.</a>)</p>

<h4 title="Sponges"><a id="pg101"></a>SPONGES</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>There are many animals which consist of but one cell. These
are called <em class="e000I2">Protozoa</em>, and comprise the <em class="e000I2">Infusoria</em> and other microscopic
organisms. The animals next higher in the scale are
<em class="e000I2">Metazoa</em>, or multicellular animals, and the first group of this subdivision
is <em class="eB0002">Porifera</em>, the sponges, the lowest of the many-celled
animals.</p>

<p>For a long time sponges occupied a disputed ground between
the animal and vegetable kingdoms. Aristotle was the first to
point out that a sponge is not a plant. The assertion was
doubted and combated, but at last the animal nature of the sponge
was established. Sponges were then believed to be colonies of
one-celled animals, but finally it was decided that they were individuals
with cells of different kinds that performed functions
analogous to those of higher organisms.</p>

<p>The sponge, as commonly seen, is only the skeleton or framework,
so to speak, of the living animal. In its natural state it is
a very different-looking object. Its entire surface is covered with
a thin slimy skin, usually of a dark color, which is perforated with
holes corresponding to the apertures of the canals. The organic
portion of the sponge is a soft, jelly-like substance composed of
three layers—the external (<em class="e000I2">ectoderm</em>), the internal (<em class="e000I2">endoderm</em>), and
the middle (<em class="e000I2">mesoderm</em>). The external layer is composed of flat
cells. The endoderm has cylindrical cells, each one of which has
a flagellate hair. The main mass of the body, the mesoderm or
middle layer, is made up of cells having various functions, some
being concerned in the formation of framework, some in digestion,
and some in reproduction.</p>

<p>The framework is secreted in the mesoderm, and in different <a id="pg102"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg102]</span>
genera consists respectively of a
horny or silicious or calcareous
substance, or of the first two of
these substances combined. The
sponge of commerce has the
first kind and is composed entirely
of exceedingly fine flexible
fibers of a horny substance called
<em class="e000I2">spongin</em>. In other species the
spongin is intermixed with spicules
of silica, or of carbonate
of lime, in various shapes. In the sponges, so much valued as
curiosities, called "Venus's flower-basket" and "glass-rope
sponge," the framework is composed of silicious spicules alone.</p>

<div class="caption">Various forms of sponge-spicules.
</div>
</div>

<p>The spicules have a great variety of shapes, being rod-like,
knobbed, three-pointed, six-pointed, anchor-like, etc., and are a
feature in the classification of sponges.</p>

<em class="e000I2">Eiz</em>, ovum.</div> </div>

<p>The sponge is traversed throughout by a canal system, consisting
of a series of tubes through which water circulates, carrying
air and food to the animal.
The exterior of the
sponge has numerous small
pores and a comparatively
few large openings. The fine
pores are inhalent, taking in
and straining the water of
its coarser floating material,
and then passing it through
perforations in their sides
into sacs lined with peculiar
cylindrical cells having flagellate
hairs, each hair having a
collar at its base. These
cells, called <em class="e000I2">choanocytes</em>, resemble
independent animals
of the <em class="e000I2">Protozoa</em>, known as
<em class="e000I2">flagellate Infusoria</em> or <em class="e000I2">Choanoflagellata</em>. <a id="pg103"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg103]</span>
They take in and
digest food and eject excrement
from the area inclosed
by the collar. The cilia (hairs)
by their constant movement
create currents which keep the
water in motion. Water, then,
is taken through the pores into
the first or incurrent canals;
thence it is passed into the
ciliated chambers, and thence
into the excurrent canals, and
out through large passages
terminating in large openings
called <em class="e000I2">oscula</em>, or craters. The
canal systems vary. In some
species they become quite complex.</p>

</div>

<p>Sponges vary greatly in
shape, size, color, surface, rigidity,
canal systems, and skeleton.
They are cake-shaped,
tubular, digitate, palmate, cup-shaped,
vase-shaped, cone-shaped,
spherical, hemispherical,
pedunculate, etc., their
shapes depending upon whether
their growth is uniform or
is excessive in a horizontal or
in a vertical direction. When
they grow evenly in both directions
massive uniform shapes
arise. If lateral growth predominates,
broad, low, and incrusting
shapes result. When
there is an excess of vertical
growth the forms are digitate; <a id="pg104"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg104]</span>
but if vertical growth is not greatly in excess and is restricted to the
marginal part, cup-shaped forms result, and tubular forms when
lateral growth is particularly restricted. In some varieties tubular
masses coalesce; sometimes flat forms unite in intricate compressed
folds. Differences in rapidity of vertical growth make
undulations more or less marked, producing lobes and protuberances.
Sometimes narrow vertical growth is retarded and horizontal
growth predominates, forming various shapes on apparent
stems.</p>

<p>Many of the horny sponges are colored, in shades of yellow,
brown, red, and violet; some are black.</p>

<p>Sponges are divided into two classes, the <em class="eB0002">Calcarea</em> and <em class="eB0002">Non-Calcarea</em>.
The former have calcareous skeletons, which make
them hard and rigid; the latter have skeletons of spongin-fiber
or of silicious spicules, or of the two combined.</p>

<p>All sponges, with the exception of one family (the <em class="e000I2">Spongillidæ</em>,
which live in fresh water), are inhabitants of the sea, and live at
various depths. The sponges of commerce belong to the <em class="e000I2">Non-Calcarea</em>
and are all confined to the genus <em class="e000I2">Spongia</em>. In this genus the
skeleton is more or less flexible, being composed of spongin.
They are shallow-water species, are confined to seas where the
waters are of comparatively uniform high temperature, and
flourish best when protected by reefs and islands.</p>

<p>There are fisheries for sponges in the waters of the West
Indies, the Bahamas, on the southern and western coasts of
Florida, and in the Mediterranean and Red seas. Those of
the Mediterranean surpass in quality the sponges of our
coasts.</p>

<p>Five species of commercial sponges are taken from Florida
waters. They are graded by the trade in the order of their importance,
as the "sheepswool," "yellow," "grass," "velvet," and
"glove." The fishing for sponges is done from small boats, two
persons manning each boat. One man sculls, while the other,
using a water-glass, scans the bottom. The water-glass is a box
with a pane of glass on the bottom. If the glass is held below the
surface and the face is placed in the box, the observer is enabled
to see with some distinctness the bottom at a considerable depth <a id="pg105"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg105]</span>
in these clear waters. The sponges are dragged up by hooks—a
primitive method which restricts the fishing to shallow water, the
fishing here being in water not deeper than thirty feet, but usually
three to twenty feet. The sponges are "killed" by being exposed
on the beach for several days; they are then placed in "crawls,"
or pens, where they are washed by the action of the waves for
about a week; then, if clean, they are dried, assorted, strung on
cords, pressed and baled for shipment. The sponge-fisheries are
of considerable value, and much attention is being given to the
subject of artificial propagation. It is thought that such beds
could be subjected to the regulations which govern oyster-beds.
Already the planting of sponges has been shown to be practicable.
The living sponge is cut to pieces, and the cuttings are
placed in favorable localities. Pieces planted in Florida waters
attain a marketable size in one year.</p>

<p>Sponges reproduce by eggs formed in the mesoderm. The
eggs escape as ciliated spheres and swim about until they find a
place on which to attach themselves. As soon as they become
fixed they grow with much rapidity into mature individuals.</p>

<p>Some species seem to prefer association with other animals and
live as commensals with crabs. The crab <em class="e000I2">Dromia</em> is always concealed
under a sponge, which grows upon its back. Spider-crabs
are often overgrown with sponges as well as seaweeds. In this
case, however, the crab finds and plants the sponge himself.
<em class="e000I2">Aplysella violacea</em> overgrows worm-tubes. Many sponges afford
shelter to numerous small animals which bore into their bodies
for protection, no animal seeming to feed upon the sponge.</p>

<p>Sponges may be found in tide-pools, on the under side of
stones, on seaweeds, and so on. A small bright-red incrusting
sponge with irregular lobe-like branches is common on the New
England coast; a thin yellow incrusting sponge also is found on
the under side of stones. <em class="e000I2">Grantia ciliata</em>, a small urn-shaped
species, having a large aperture at the summit, is found in tide-pools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most singular in habit of any sponge is <em class="e000I2">Cliona
sulphurea</em>, the boring-sponge, a common species found from Cape
Cod to South Carolina and abundant in Long Island Sound. It <a id="pg106"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg106]</span>
is bright sulphur-yellow in color, grows in irregular masses of
considerable size and fine texture, and has low wart-like prominences.
It lives on shells spreading over both surfaces, at first
forming little burrows, but eventually penetrating the shell in
every direction, honeycombing and at last completely destroying
it by absorption. Sometimes it settles upon living shells and
greatly irritates the animal, which constantly secretes new lime
to cover the perforations in its shell.</p>

<p>These sponges are an important factor in the economy of the
sea, as they disintegrate dead shells, which would otherwise
accumulate in vast quantities.</p>

sponges depends largely upon physical conditions. <em class="e000I2">E. officinalis</em> has
an average height of five to six inches. It grows on rocky bottoms
in shallow water on the east coast of Florida. This species has a number
of varieties of various forms; some are dome-shaped, others tubular,
rotund, flabellate, etc. The surface is covered with fine tufts and is
generally free from ridges. On the sides are numerous small apertures,
<a id="pg108"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg108]</span> and one or more large oscula occur on top. The color of the living

<h4 title="Cœlenterata"><a id="pg113"></a>CŒLENTERATA</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The animals included in the phylum <em class="eB0002">Cœlenterata</em> were once all
called <em class="e000I2">zoöphytes</em>, or animal plants, because of their resemblance
to vegetable forms. The name <em class="e000I2">Cœlenterata</em> is derived
from two Greek words meaning "hollow" and "intestine," and
it describes the anatomical structure of each member of the
group. They are commonly known as polyps. In the simplest
forms the parts which perform the different functions cannot be
distinguished one from the other, and even in higher forms there
is but little differentiation. Shakspere's description of old age
applies to them: "Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything."</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this very low order of animals has, like the
higher orders, such a diversity of form and habit as to require
classification. Some of them are stationary, and of these some
branch like plants; some move about by the aid of tentacles, some
move by means of vibrating cilia, and others move by the contraction
and expansion of the soft body.</p>

<p>Cuvier included them in his <em class="e000I2">Radiata</em>, a class comprising all the
animals whose parts diverge or radiate from a central axis.
Recent classification has divided the radiate animals into several
classes. This arrangement of parts is obviously quite different
from that of bilateral symmetry, or the disposal of parts on each
side of a longitudinal axis. The type of radiate structure is
shown in polyps. The body is a sac, in the center of which is
another sac or axis. This is the digestive cavity. Vertical
partitions extend from the central to the outer sac, forming distinct
<a id="pg114"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg114]</span> divisions or chambers. The number of divisions varies
with the different species and also with the age of the animal.
Other partitions start from the outer sac, and extend toward the
central axis, but do not unite with it. These partitions, called
<em class="e000I2">mesenteries</em>, are always in definite multiples, varying in different
species, new divisions growing between the first partitions in
regular order. On the inner edge of these
partitions the eggs of the animal are
formed, which, when mature, drop into
the chambers and pass through openings
into the inner sac, or digestive cavity, and
out of the mouth into the water.</p>

<img src="images/i170.jpg" width="178" height="177" alt="" />
<div class="caption">Diagram of radiate structure.</div>
</div>

<p>The animals are classed according as the
eggs are formed on all or on special partitions,
those being of the highest order
where a limitation and constancy of function
is maintained. The upper surface
of the body has hollow tentacles, each one of which opens into
one of the chambers and extends outward. All parts of the
animal communicate, and whatever enters the mouth circulates
through the whole structure; and when assimilation is completed
the residue returns by the same road and is expelled
through the mouth. This structure is common to all polyps;
but there are great differences in their texture, some being soft
and some horny, while others deposit a calcareous skeleton
(corals). Some grow in colonies, like the hydroids and corals,
and are stationary, others are free and independent; some have
but few, others have many tentacles; and they differ widely in
size, form, and color.</p>

<p>Hydroids, sea-anemones, corals, sea-fans, starfishes, and sea-urchins
are different examples of the radiate structure. They are
not, however, all of them polyps.</p>

<div class="inlinelist">

SEAWEED-LIKE ZOÖPHYTES AND SMALL JELLYFISHES</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The hydroids have been called the nurses of jellyfishes. From
casual observation these two forms would not be associated
together, for the shrub-like organisms, which so much resemble
plants that they are often collected and preserved as seaweeds,
suggest only vegetable life. Examined with a glass, however,
they disclose their animal nature. Along the stems, arranged in
various ways, are small cups, from which protrude the numerous
moving tentacles of the little polyps living within them.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Hydroids are colonies of associated animals living a communal
life.</em> The multitude of individuals composing the colony are
invested with a horny covering, the <em class="e000I2">perisarc</em>, which in some genera
assumes a tree-like form. Through these stems and branches
runs a fleshy tube, a thread of animal substance, which connects
in one living whole the zoöids, or individuals of the community.
There is division of labor, as in other communities: some of the
zoöids obtain the food for the colony, and have tentacles around
their open mouths; others have no mouths, but reproduce the
species, and at certain stages of development liberate swimming-bells,
or small jellyfishes (medusæ).</p>

<p>The typical hydroid colony is attached by a kind of creeping
stem from which arises a vertical axis, which gives off short
lateral, alternate branches bearing zoöids at their ends. There
is often more complex branching. The zoöids in certain genera
(tubularians) are uncovered; in others (sertularians) they are
incased in a glassy, cup-like, horny sheath.</p>

<p>Three kinds of zoöids, polyps, or hydranths—as they are indiscriminately
called—are attached to the stem. Those having an <a id="pg120"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg120]</span>
open end and a crown of tentacles are the nutritive individuals.
Small, club-like dilations are immature zoöids. The <em class="e000I2">blastostyles</em>,
or reproductive zoöids, are long, cylindrical, mouthless, and covered.
At maturity the cover is ruptured, and the medusæ have
the appearance of a pile of thin saucers attached by the middle
of the convex side. When at length these saucers are set free
as little medusæ, or jellyfishes, the convex side of each saucer, or
swimming-bell, is called the <em class="e000I2">ex-umbrella</em>; the concave, under side,
the <em class="e000I2">subumbrella</em>. From the center of the subumbrella projects
the <em class="e000I2">manubrium</em>, or stomach of the animal. At the free end of the
manubrium is a four-cornered mouth. From the attached end
of the <em class="e000I2">manubrium</em> four tubes or canals diverge, and, extending
through the animal, open into a circular canal which runs
around the margin of the umbrella. When the medusa is as
above described, it has reached the highest point in its
development.</p>

<p>When the medusa has matured, it lays eggs, known as <em class="e000I2">planulæ</em>.
These are spherical bodies covered with cilia (hairs), by means of
which they swim about for a time; but they finally attach themselves
to some object, there to grow and develop into hydroid
colonies. The cycle of life is thus completed. This process is
known as <em class="e000I2">alternation of generation</em>, or <em class="e000I2">metagenesis</em>, one life-history
containing two quite different forms of being. The term of life
of an individual is one year, the zoöphyte stage beginning in the
autumn and the medusa stage in the spring.</p>

<p>Some medusæ, besides reproducing by means of eggs, multiply
by budding, small medusæ growing on the manubrium or on the
margin of the umbrella. <em class="e000I2">Sarsia</em> and <em class="e000I2">Lizzia</em> sometimes increase
by budding.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Hydrozoa</em> are not all of the above type. In the sertularians
the zoöids perish on the stem and have no medusa life, their
reproductive element giving rise to the hydroid form without
metamorphosis. The <em class="e000I2">Trachylinæ</em> have no hydroid life, being
always free-swimming medusæ; others, the <em class="e000I2">Siphonophora</em>, live a
hydroid life which is unattached, the colony floating on the ocean;
the millepores secrete calcareous skeletons and always remain
fixed, reproducing by budding. <a id="pg121"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg121]</span></p>

<p>Hydroids are very abundant, but are comprised in the few
groups mentioned: namely, those which live only in the fixed
colonial state; those which have alternation of generation, being
first hydroids and then swimming-bells, or medusæ; those
which live always in the medusa state, the eggs of the jellyfish
developing at once into other medusæ; and the <em class="e000I2">Siphonophora</em>, or
those which have a floating colonial state, the hydroid never being
attached, but floating at large and capable of locomotion, some of
the colony having the function of propulsion.</p>

<p>Hydroids are particularly interesting as exemplifying the close
resemblance that may exist in outward appearance between animal
and vegetable life and as illustrations of communal life and
of the alternation of generation. A few examples of different
types are given below.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">LEPTOLINIÆ</em></h5>

<p>The members of this order agree in all essential particulars
being branched colonies having two principal forms of zoöids,
the nutritive and the reproductive. Some genera attain the
length of several inches, or even feet; others are very small tufts
growing on shells and seaweeds. The cup may completely inclose
the zoöid and be close to the stem (sessile), as in sertularians;
it may be on the end of a short stalk, as in campanularians;
or it may not reach above the base of the zoöid, as in
tubularians. The genera are based upon these differences in the
perisarc.</p>

<p>The hydroids, like all other classes, exist in such great variety
that it would be impracticable to describe here the many named
species; but to recognize the genera is simple. A long tubular
pedicel without a cup is characteristic of the tubularians; the campanularians
have an arborescent form and bell-shaped cups on
stalks; the sertularians have sessile cups; and the plumularians
have a feather-like form, with zoöid-cups on one side only of the
branches.</p>

<p>The beautiful and varied structure of these "animal plants" is
most interesting, and to be fully appreciated they should be seen <a id="pg122"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg122]</span>
in life and examined with a glass. Some species are confined to
deep water, but many are littoral and to be found in tide-pools,
in the chinks and crannies of rocks, under stones, and under the
hanging <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>. The horny skeletons of large varieties are frequently
washed ashore, and in their tangled masses smaller
living species often may be found.</p>

<h6>THE TUBULARIANS</h6>

<p>This division is characterized by zoöids borne on long, slender
stems which are sometimes simple and small, sometimes branching
and eight to ten inches long. The zoöid has two rows of
tentacles, the central one being sometimes on a kind of proboscis.
The reproductive zoöids are in bunches, sometimes below
the outer row of tentacles, sometimes between the two rows.
The perisarc does not cover the zoöid. In color they are commonly
red or yellow.</p>

several feet of the surface of the rock with a delicate velvet-like carpet.
It is red in color and is, apparently, a soft and tender species, but it
thrives on the most exposed beaches. The colonies are cylindrical tubes
about one quarter of an inch in height, rising from a creeping stem
(<em class="e000I2">hydrorhiza</em>). Each tube is surmounted by a zoöid with fifteen to thirty
tentacles, which is constantly changing form by its contractions. Below
the tentacles are reproductive buds arranged in clusters. Common from
Long Island Sound northward. (<a href="#Plate-XLI">Plate XLI.</a>)</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. polyclina.</em> The soft, pinkish covering often seen on shells inhabited
by hermit-crabs. This association of two different kinds of animals
is known as <em class="e000I2">commensalism</em>, and is a partnership formed for the benefit of
one or both the individuals. In this case the mossy appearance of the
hydroid conceals the shell, while the stinging-cells with which it is invested
are weapons of defense against the enemies of the crab and also
help to paralyze its prey. In return for these favors the colony is
moved about, thereby obtaining perhaps better oxygenation. Originally
it was thought that <em class="e000I2">Hydractinia</em> lived only on the shells occupied by
hermit-crabs, and that the nomadic life was essential to its existence; but
this is not the case, for it is also found growing on rocks in tide-pools.
These colonies arise from a creeping stem, which forms a horny, root-like
<a id="pg123"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg123]</span>  network over a surface and develops at intervals
projecting points on which the zoöids live. Each
colony consists of feeding members, of reproductive
members, and of a third kind which seems to have
a protective function. These last are more slender
than the others, and are without tentacles, but are
armed with lasso-&#160;or stinging-cells. The colonies are
of different sexes, the male being lighter in color than
the female colonies. The eggs develop into planulæ,
which swim about for a while and then give rise to
other colonies. It is found from New Jersey northward,
and is very abundant in Long Island Sound.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. superciliaris.</em> This hydroid is found in tide-pools on the New
England coast, growing in clusters, about two inches high, attached to
rocks or to mussel-shells. The stem is very slender, and branches. It is
red in color. The medusæ which it liberates are found in great numbers
in the spring. The tiny swimming-bells are nearly globular. The tentacles
are long, are arranged in four clusters on the margin, and extend in
every direction. The manubrium is yellow and short, and the mouth is
concealed by four clusters of short tentacles. On these oral tentacles
<a id="pg125"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg125]</span>  the eggs of the animal are produced. In its habits it is sluggish, often
remaining in one position for several days.</p></div>

<h6>THE CAMPANULARIANS</h6>

<p>The hydroids which have an open, bell-shaped cup at the termination
of a short, stalk-like stem, or branchlet, are mostly
campanularians. This division embraces jellyfishes of different
families. Many medusæ cannot be referred with certainty to
the hydroids from which they sprang, and the medusa-buds of
many of the hydroids have not been noted.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. commissuralis.</em> This is a delicate, much-branched hydroid, five
to six inches long, found at low-water mark in tide-pools, attached to
stones and seaweeds, along the rocky shores from Nova Scotia to South
Carolina. Its branches are arranged spirally and spread nearly at right
angles to the main stem, and the main branches subdivide in a similar
manner. Every interval of the stem has a slight curve, and at the base
of every branch there are four or five rings. The ultimate branches, or
pedicels, bear at their ends bell-shaped cups which have even edges,
but are twelve-sided and slightly incurved. The pedicels are ringed for
the whole length. The reproductive cups on short ringed pedicels are
larger than the others, and occupy the angles of the branches. These
cups are constricted and again expanded at the apex, forming an urn-like
top.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. diaphana.</em> This species is often abundant on the fronds of <em class="e000I2">Laminaria</em>
washed ashore, and also on <em class="e000I2">Rhodymenia</em> and <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>. It has a
creeping base, zigzag in form, but keeping a straight course, and in its
branching often forming a network over the surface of the flat fronds.
At each angle of the creeping stems rises a pedicel about an inch high,
which inclines in the direction of the stem and terminates in a zoöid-cup
similar in form to that of <em class="e000I2">Obelia</em>. The medusa which this hydroid liberates
is called <em class="e000I2">Thaumatias diaphana</em>. The swimming-bell is very shallow
and thin, turning inside out at almost every pulsation. The tentacles
are numerous and rigid like stiff hairs. This little medusa is very active
and is abundant. The species is found from Long Island Sound northward.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. languida.</em> This medusa is one inch in diameter and one half of
an inch high, and is so delicate and transparent that it is hardly visible

no tentacles; later the disk flattens and has from thirty-two to thirty-six
<a id="pg126"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg126]</span> tentacles and numerous eye-spots. When disturbed it flattens its
disk and folds together, leaving its tentacles sprawled in every direction.
It is very languid in its movements, and often remains in one position
for hours. These medusæ are found only in the hottest hours of the
day, but are very plentiful then, shoals of them often stretching for
miles, and so thick as to touch one another. Their habitat is the New
England coast.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. poterium.</em> This hydroid is found creeping over seaweeds in tide-pools
from Long Island Sound northward. The main stem is prostrate,
or root-like, running over the body to which it is attached. The stems
rise as do the tubularians. The sterile zoöids are on single stems about
one quarter of an inch high. The stems are faintly ringed for their
entire length, and at the top have a distinct ring, on which rests an open,
bell-shaped cup, which is smooth around the rim. The reproductive
zoöids are on very short pedicels, and the cups are long and cylindrical,
with a wavy outline. (<a href="#Plate-XLII-A">Plate XLII, A</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. bicophora.</em> This species is found in the same places as the preceding,
and is of about the same size. The long stems are more or less
ringed and sometimes branched. The edges of the cups are notched.
The medusa-buds are urn-shaped and ringed, and are on very short
pedicels. (<a href="#Plate-XLII">Plate XLII.</a>)</p></div>

<h6>THE SERTULARIANS</h6>

<p>The sertularians are distinguished by the horny cup, which is
sessile—that is, set directly against the stem instead of being
raised upon a stalk. They are among the most common objects
of the beach, and, like the plumularians, are often mistaken for
plants by the amateur collector and are gathered and pressed as
seaweeds. They are found everywhere along the coast. They
zigzag over the fronds of seaweeds or hang in fringes upon them,
as well as upon rocks, stones, and shells. They well repay close
examination with a glass. Every open cup bears a wreath of
tentacles, which makes the branch a spray of stars. This is not
an inappropriate comparison, for besides their starry shape some
species emit a phosphorescent light.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. pumila.</em> The most abundant of all the hydroids on the northeast
coast is this species, which is found in profusion upon <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> and other
seaweeds, and mingled with them upon the rocks. It is easily distinguished
from the campanularians because its zoöid-cups are close against
the stems (sessile) instead of on stalks or pedicels. The stem creeps
<a id="pg127"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg127]</span>  over the fronds of seaweeds, often crossing and recrossing in a tangled
mass. At short intervals the upright, straight branches rise to one inch
or one and a half inches in height, and are more or less branched. All
except the creeping stems are close set on each side, with cylindrical
zoöid-cups which turn outward at the ends. The cups of the reproductive
zoöids are not sessile; they are much larger than those of the nutritive
ones and are urn-shaped. (<a href="#Plate-XLII-A">Plate XLII, A</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. argentea.</em> This is a beautiful species, common from New Jersey
northward. It has a profusion of silvery branches on a dark stem. The
colonies are often a foot or more long, and the branches at the top and
bottom of the stem are shorter and fewer than those in the middle of
the colony. The zoöid-cups are nearly cylindrical, pressed closely to the
stem, nearly opposite or subalternate to one another, and end in
pointed tips. The medusa-bud is urn-shaped, with two horns at the top.

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. cupressina</em>, the sea-cypress. This species is similar to
<em class="e000I2">S. argentea</em>,
but the main stem is thicker and longer, and the branches less crowded
and less subdivided. The branches are arched or drooping, instead of
straight, and gradually decrease in length at some distance from the
lower and upper parts of the stem, giving a spire-like apex, the stem
often continuing into a bare, branchless extremity. The zoöid-cups are
tubular, not much narrowed or divergent above, and two-lipped on the
margin. It is found from New Jersey northward. (<a href="#Plate-XLII-B">Plate XLII, B</a>.)</p></div>

<h6>THE PLUMULARIANS</h6>

<p>These hydroids are feather-like in the manner of branching,
short lateral branches being arranged on each side of a long central
stem. In some species the stems are naked below and
resemble quills. The zoöid-cups are only on one side of the
short branches. (<a href="#Plate-XLIII">Plate XLIII.</a>)</p>

in size and color, but always suggests a small ostrich-plume. The zoöid-cups
are arranged in a single row on one side of each short branch, and
the main stem has a joint between each of the branches, which are
placed quite close together. The rims of the cups have sharp-pointed
teeth, and from the top emerge three tubular projections, which are
called <em class="e000I2">nematophores</em>, and are supposed to be degenerate zoöids. At intervals
a branch is replaced by a cylindrical body covered with nematophores,
and in these the generative zoöids are developed. (<a href="#Plate-XLIII">Plate XLIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p>The genus <em class="eB00I2">Millepora</em> ("thousand

also in the arrangement of
the stony partitions, which in

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. alcicornis</em>, elk-horn coral. This beautiful coral, which is abundant
in Florida and contributes to the building of the reefs, rises in
broad expansions, more or less lobed, and suggests by its shape the
object for which it is named. The whole mass is porous, being traversed
by innumerable canals. Its surface, although smooth compared with
that of other corals, is covered with very minute pores, which are of two
sizes. The larger ones are the <em class="e000I2">gastropores</em>, or stomach-pores, in which the
nutritive animal lives; it has a cylindrical body, with four knob-like

The cups occupied by the zoöids are shallow. As one animal dies,
another succeeds it and builds a horizontal partition separating the

<p>This order of hydroids consists of free-floating communities

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. cara.</em> This species is found on the New England coast. The
members of the community are arranged along a hollow stem about three
inches long which opens into
every individual. At the top
of the stem is a sac, or float;
just below this is a group of
swimming-bells which have
no manubrium or mouth, and
whose sole function is to provide
locomotion for the community;
and below these are
three sets of zoöids, each
having a triangular shield
and tentacles. The tentacles
are longer than the main stem.
One of these last groups consists
of the nutritive members,
the mouths of the community,
resembling manubriums of
swimming-bells out of place.
Each one has at the point of
attachment a bunch of long,
delicate tentacles having pendent
knobs of lasso-cells. A
second group, also with
mouths, has shorter tentacles
which are carried in spiral
coils. The members of the
third group have but one tentacle
each and resemble the
float at the end of the stem;
presumably these drop off and
produce new colonies. There
are also on the lower part of
the stem other reproductive

the upper side of this air-vessel is a crest, or
sail, and from the under side depend long
tentacles, or streamers. Some of these tentacles
are covered with stinging-&#160;or lasso-cells;
some are the feeding zoöids, with flask-shaped
bodies, and some, which look like
bunches of grapes, are the reproductive
zoöids. The tentacles in this curious cluster
are all close together and hang from one
side of the float, near the broader end. The
longest are on the outside, which may be
called the windward side, since they serve to
keep the crest, or sail, before the wind; and
when the wind is strong they stretch out to
a remarkable length,—forty to fifty feet,—acting
as anchors to keep the colony from
being driven ashore. They also change its
course by raising the pointed end of the
float, thus forcing it to "come about." These
long tentacles, ordinarily carried more or less
curled up, are in bunches of two to four, and
emerge from a common stem. Clusters of
similar, but smaller, tentacles alternate with
the larger ones, but grow somewhat nearer
the pointed end of the float; these are purely
locomotive organs. Next come two smaller
sets of appendages, also of unequal size,
which are the nutritive organs of the community.
They are clustered together on a
stem like the others. The appendages of
the third kind are small, resemble bunches
of grapes, and are scattered among the nutritive hydræ. These last
are the reproductive zoöids of the community.</p></div>

 CLASS <em class="eBU001">SCYPHOZOA</em>
 <span class="smaller">THE LARGE JELLYFISHES</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>There is perhaps no marine animal which excites more wonder
than the jellyfish. Its transparency, its graceful rhythmical
movements, its long streaming tentacles, the variety and eccentricity
of its form, and often of its color, attract attention, and
one naturally desires to know something of its life-history. Jellyfishes
are also called <em class="e000I2">medusæ</em>, because their long appendages suggest
the locks of the Gorgon; <em class="e000I2">acalephs</em>, on account of their stinging
or nettle-like properties; and sun-jellies, sea-blubbers, etc., because
they float upon the surface during the warmest part of the
day, when the sun is high. The name <em class="e000I2">jellyfish</em> is inappropriate,
since the animal in no way resembles a fish except in the fact
that it swims; but it is, nevertheless, the commonest name.</p>

<p>Jellyfishes vary in size from that of a pinhead to six or seven
feet in diameter. They differ in the number, size, and position
of the tentacles, the number of the radial canals, the form of the
manubrium, the position of the egg-sacs, etc.; but the general
plan of the internal structure is the same in all species. In shape
they are compared to a mushroom. From the center of an umbrella-like
top falls a central organ like the stalk of a mushroom.
It is called the <em class="e000I2">manubrium</em> and is the mouth and stomach of the
animal.</p>

<p>From the top of the manubrium radiate straight or branched
tubes, which are connected with a canal which runs around the
whole margin of the umbrella. Extending around the inner
circumference of the disk in certain species (usually the hydroid
medusæ), there is a horizontal shelf, called the <em class="e000I2">velum</em>, or veil, because
it sometimes falls like a veil. <a id="pg135"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg135]</span></p>

<p>From the margin of the umbrella depend the tentacles. There
are little mineral deposits, like crystals, called <em class="e000I2">lithocysts</em>, disposed
at intervals on the margin, and known also as <em class="e000I2">marginal bodies</em>,
which are supposed to be eyes. In some species these lithocysts
are inclosed in club-shaped bodies, and they are then called <em class="e000I2">tentaculocysts</em>,
because they are like small tentacles. These, together
with the nerve-fibers, are called the sense-organs; but to what
extent jellyfishes can see and feel is undetermined. This is the
first appearance of sense-organs in animals. Around the concave
surface of the umbrella is a muscular zone, or zone of contractile
tissue, by which the animal opens and shuts the umbrella
and gets its locomotive power. The <em class="e000I2">gonads</em>, which are conspicuous
from being more opaque than the rest of the body, are
the egg-&#160;or sperm-sacs. They vary in form and in position.</p>

<p>The jellyfish is carnivorous, feeding on small organisms such
as crustaceans and even fishes. The tentacles are invested with
stinging-cells, as are also the frills about the mouth, when such
occur. With these stinging-cells, which are in some species so
powerful as to have been compared with an electric battery, the
jellyfish benumbs its prey. The stinging properties are due to
nettle-like threads contained in poison-cells. When these penetrate
the flesh they produce a pain similar to that of an electric
shock.</p>

<p>The food is taken into the manubrium by the square mouth at
its free end, and is there digested. It is then sent as nutritive
fluid through the canal system of the body, and ejected through
small pores in the canal which surrounds the margin of the
umbrella.</p>

<p>There are two sexes. The gonads of the female contain eggs;
those of the male, sperms. The contents of the gonads drop
into the central cavity and pass out through the mouth. The
fertilized ovum is called a <em class="e000I2">planula</em>, and is a transparent sphere
covered with cilia, by means of which it swims about for a time.
At length it attaches itself to some object, and becomes in some
species a branching colony (hydroid), in other species a <em class="e000I2">strobila</em>.
The latter, as it grows, is constricted at intervals, and at maturity
resembles a pile of inverted saucers with lobed edges. Each of <a id="pg136"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg136]</span>
these saucers is finally detached, and when liberated is called an
<em class="e000I2">ephyrula</em>, and becomes a jellyfish. Thus its cycle of life is complete.
There are some species which, having no hydroid or strobila
state, mature without alternation of generation (<em class="e000I2">metagenesis</em>).</p>

<p>The term of life of the jellyfish does not exceed one year.
Even the giant <em class="e000I2">Cyanea</em> attains its immense growth in six months.
It starts in the spring as an ephyrula, not more than one half of
an inch in diameter, and when it dies in the autumn is often six
to eight feet in diameter. The bodies of jellyfishes are ninety-nine
per cent. water, and the dead ones thrown upon the beaches
by the autumn storms rapidly disappear, leaving no traces behind.</p>

<p>The powerful stinging-cells with which the large medusæ are
armed make them formidable enemies, and it is probable that
some deaths by drowning are caused by swimmers encountering
them and becoming paralyzed by them.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. auricula.</em> This little iridescent jellyfish, which measures about
one and a half inches in diameter, is commonly found attached to eel-grass
by a stalk-like projection of the top of the umbrella. Short, globe-tipped
tentacles are arranged in eight clusters, each cluster on a raised
prolongation of the margin of the umbrella, and in the center of each
space between them is a dark kidney-shaped organ called the <em class="e000I2">anchor</em>.
These anchors are used for holding, either for suspension or when moving
from place to place. The mouth forms a slight quadrangular projection
in the center of the bell-like expansion. The arm-like projections are mottled
with two rows of spots, which are the ova. Although a free form
and capable of moving about, <em class="e000I2">Lucernaria</em> is sedentary in habit. It is
sometimes found free, but generally attached by its extremity to eel-grass
or <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>, seldom to rocks. It is constantly changing its shape.
The one it most frequently assumes is that of a cup or inverted bell. It
is found on the New England coast. (<a href="#Plate-XLIV">Plate XLIV.</a>)</p></div>

transparent bluish-white, broad and comparatively flat, with a fringe of
short tentacles of even length around the margin; margin broken by
eight notches, in each one of which is a club-like organ (<em class="e000I2">tentaculocyst</em>) containing
calcareous spots or eyes, which are hidden by lappets or hood-like
coverings; groups of nerve-cells
also lie in the marginal
notches; radial canals branched;
manubrium very short, with
square mouth, which is surrounded
by delicate membranes,
or oral arms, each arm being
a folded membrane tapering to
a point. The edges of the membranes
are covered with lasso-&#160;or
stinging-cells. Four egg-sacs,
or gonads, are conspicuous in
horseshoe shape around the
center of the disk. The gonads
are pink in the males, and yellow
in the females. These medusæ
swim in shoals, and are common
everywhere in summer. They
may be said to be annual animals,
for they make their appearance
regularly as free-swimming
medusæ in the latter
part of April, when they may be
seen in immense numbers near the surface when the water is smooth and
the sky clear. At this time they are about an inch in diameter. They
grow rapidly, and by the end of June have attained their full size. At
<a id="pg138"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg138]</span> the end of July they are fully developed, and begin to discharge their eggs,
which go into the folds around the mouth and remain there until they attain
the planula stage. After the spawning
period the medusæ, reduced in strength, are
unable to resist the storms of the autumn,
and many of them are cast ashore; many
others, in a more or less wasted condition,
float near the surface, but the body is less
transparent, its tissues are thickened, its
tentacles gone, and general dissolution has
commenced. In this condition the medusæ
are frequently capsized by the air which accumulates
in the empty egg-cavities, and,
floating helplessly on the surface, are attacked
and destroyed by swarms of small
crustaceans; thus their cycle of life is terminated.
It has been suggested that the
destruction of the mothers, by being cast
upon the beaches in the autumnal gales, is a provision to set free the
planulæ in a position favorable to their existence; for when liberated
they fasten upon the rocks and seaweeds
of the shore, where, during the
winter months, they develop into strobilæ,
which in turn free their saucer-like
disks early in April.</p></div>

measure seven and a half feet across the disk and have tentacles
more than one hundred feet long. Usually they are three to five
feet in diameter, with tentacles thirty to forty feet long. The
disk is red, the margin white and scalloped. The tentacles, of
different colors, are covered with lasso-&#160;or stinging-cells,
and are arranged in eight distinct, thick clusters on the

curtains, much folded and ruffled, whose edges at times look as
if they were embroidered, because great numbers of discharged
eggs are attached to them. Four egg-sacs hang from the disk

circular disk, on the margin of which are sixteen sense-organs
(tentaculocysts), but no tentacles. The lower end of the manubrium,
which in other jellyfishes is an open mouth, is closed by eight
arms which emanate from it and are usually extended laterally,
lying parallel to the disk. These arms are much branched, and
the branches, in turn, have numerous appendages. Some of these
appendages look like little polyps and have mouths surrounded by
crowns of tentacles; others are ovoid bodies without external
openings, but with a central cavity connected with vessels
leading to the arms. The former are mouths, but the function of
the ovoid bodies is not known. Although able to swim freely, <em

attached, and languidly opens and closes its disk, rarely changing
its position. Its arms, extending upward, appear like the fronds
of algæ. These jellyfishes are common on the Florida coast,
huddled together on the sands of the coral reefs. (<a href="#Plate-XLIV">Plate XLIV.</a>) <a

 CLASS <em class="eBU001">ACTINOZOA</em> <span class="smaller">SEA-ANEMONES,
 REEF-CORALS, SEA-FANS, SEA-WHIPS, AND SEA-PENS</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The animals of this class are divided into two subclasses,
based on the following anatomical differences: In the first
subdivision, which includes the sea-anemones and the reef-building
corals, the polyps have numerous simple, hollow tentacles and
radial partitions of the same number, both being some multiple
of six. The polyps of a colony are all alike, and the hard matter
they secrete is carbonate of lime. In the second subdivision,
the <em class="e000I2">Alcyonaria</em>,—or halcyonoids, as they are commonly called,—the
tentacles and radial partitions are always eight in number,
and the tentacles have small symmetrical appendages or branches.
The polyps of this group are often accompanied by small zoöids
having no tentacles. The hard secretions are horny and elastic,
as in sea-fans, sea-whips, and sea-pens, or they are extremely hard,
as in <em class="e000I2">Corallina rubrum</em>.</p>

<h5>SUBCLASS <em class="eBU001">ZOANTHARIA</em>
<span class="smaller">("<em class="e000I2">Animal-flowers</em>")</span></h5>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">ACTINIARIA</em>
<span class="smaller">SEA-ANEMONES</span></h6>

<p>These curious and, at times, beautiful creatures are polyps, and
are constructed on the radial system. They have a cylindrical body
with a broad base and rows of hollow tentacles around the upper
disk. They have a central sac, and a space between the outer and
inner sacs which is divided vertically by walls called <em class="e000I2">mesenteries</em>,
as explained on <a href="#pg114">page 114</a>. Each tentacle, however many there <a id="pg143"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg143]</span>
may be, has a corresponding chamber. The inner sac has a mouth,
like a slit, at the top of the disk, opening to the outside, and it
also has openings into the chambered spaces which surround it.
These chambers also open into the hollow tentacles; thus a continuous
circulation throughout the whole animal is established.</p>

<p>The food taken in at the mouth is digested in the inner sac,
passes through all the chambers of the cavity as nutritive fluid, and
is then expelled at the mouth again. The inner sac, or gullet, has
longitudinal grooves; two of these are broad and deep, and correspond
to the corners of the mouth. These are called <em class="e000I2">siphonoglyphs</em>.
The sea-anemone is soft and contractile, and belongs to the only
order of this class which does not secrete a skeleton. It has two
sets of muscles, one of which extends from the base to the summit
of the body and is placed on the dividing partitions. Sea-anemones
are classified by the arrangement of the septa and the
manner in which the muscles are placed upon them. The other
set of muscles is arranged around the circumference of the column
or body. Each tentacle is furnished with similar sets of
muscles. The animal is sensitive, and at the least alarm contracts
its body by means of these muscles, and quickly transforms
itself from a beautiful, flower-like form into a shapeless,
unattractive, inconspicuous mass.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Actiniaria</em> are developed from the egg. The eggs form
on the edges of the inner walls (mesenteries), and when mature
drop into the outer sac (gullet), and out of the mouth as ciliated
spheres (planulæ). After swimming about for a time these attach
themselves to rocks, and, conforming to the irregularities of
the surface, secure a tight hold. The upper surface of the
planula then becomes depressed and forms a gullet, and in time a
complete animal is formed. The <em class="e000I2">Actiniaria</em> reproduce also by
budding. A small protuberance or simple elevation of the body-wall
appears on the side at the base, or in some species on the
disk of the animal, which generally develops into a complete
animal and at maturity falls away from the parent. Sometimes
several anemones bud simultaneously from the same individual,
and a third generation commences to bud at the same time from
the immature young of the parent stock. The sea-anemones increase
<a id="pg144"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg144]</span> also by self-division. In this case a constriction is formed,
which gradually deepens and forms a complete partition of the
body, and two individuals exist where originally there was but one.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Actiniaria</em> are carnivorous and very voracious. They feed
on small organisms and on shell-fish and crustaceans, which they
suck out of their shells. To secure their prey they are armed
with an abundant supply of stinging-cells on the tentacles, and
also with fine stinging-threads which are ejected from pores
which are distributed over the whole body.</p>

<p>Sea-anemones vary greatly in color and form, and when expanded
suggest flowers, but do not resemble the one for which
they are named. They abound on every shore, the same genus
often being found in widely separated regions. They are larger
and more highly colored in tropical waters. Many of the species
are littoral, and are found in the tide-pools of rocky caverns,
on the under side of rocks, and on the piles of wharves and
bridges at low-water mark. The majority of them are attached,
but are able to change their location; others, <em class="e000I2">Edwardsia</em> and
<em class="e000I2">Cerianthus</em>, swim about when young, and in the adult state burrow
in the sand or mud, leaving only their tentacles exposed. <em class="e000I2">Bucidium
parasiticum</em> is parasitic on the folds of the membrane which
hangs from the mouth of the large jellyfish <em class="e000I2">Cyanea arctica</em>. <em class="e000I2">Fenja</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Peachia</em> lie on the sea-bottom, with their bodies horizontal
like a worm, the mouth-end and tentacles erect.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Adamsia palliata</em> furnishes another example of commensalism;
it lives on the back of shells, commonly the whelk, inhabited by
hermit-crabs. <em class="e000I2">Minyas</em> is pelagic; it has a float at one end, and by
means of its tentacles swims about freely.</p>

<p>A very few species only are described below, since these polyps
are unmistakable, being always columnar bodies, with the upper
disk more or less crowded with tentacles, and so brilliant in coloring
and beautiful in form as to attract attention if found in
the expanded state; otherwise they are easily overlooked.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. marginatum.</em> This is the most conspicuous and abundant sea-anemone
of the northeastern coast. It is common from New York
<a id="pg145"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg145]</span> northward, and is found near low-water mark in tide-pools, on the under
side of large stones, in sheltered crevices of rocks, and on the piles of
wharves and bridges. In contraction it is a broad, low cone, but when
expanded is sometimes ten inches across the disk. Allied species found
in Florida are eighteen inches in diameter. The column is smooth,
cylindrical, and broader than long. At the top is a slightly elevated,
thickened fold, and above this a deeply folded and frilled margin, with
numerous fine, short tentacles, appearing like a fringe, which cover the
upper side of the disk half-way to the oval mouth. The color is exceedingly
variable; commonly the column is yellowish-brown, but it may be
pink, white, salmon, orange, or dark brown, or striped or mottled with
different colors. The disk and folds are lighter or flesh-colored, and the
tentacles are of varying colors, usually grayish with tips of brighter
colors. When irritated this species throws out from the column numbers
of long, slender white threads (<em class="e000I2">acontia</em>), which are covered with
minute stinging-cells. These organs of defense protect the animal
from the attacks of many enemies.</p></div>

mottled with crimson, often bright cherry-red, with the thick tentacles
somewhat lighter in shade, or flesh-colored. The animal is found in
shallow water. It assumes various shapes, changing every few minutes.
The tentacles are short, conical, and uniform in size; the column, the

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">MADREPORARIA</em><span class="smaller">
STONE- OR REEF-CORALS</span></h6>

<p>The coral resembles the sea-anemone and is a polyp constructed
on the radial plan (<a href="#pg113">page 113</a>). It lives in colonies, but,
unlike the hydroid colonies, each polyp of the community is a
complete organism, and in the reef-building corals all the individual
polyps of a colony are alike. The home of each animal is
called a <em class="e000I2">corallite</em>, and the aggregation of many corallites is a
<em class="e000I2">corallum</em>.</p>

<p>The corallite is composed of carbonate of lime secreted by the
polyp, and, broadly speaking, may be called a skeleton. The
secretion forms a basal plate and radiating partitions between
the mesenteries in the cavity of the animal, and also surrounds
the polyp like a cup. In some species this is a solid substance;
in others it is like a network through which the animal substance
(cœnosarc) of the zoöids of the colony is connected, as in
<em class="e000I2">Madrepora</em>.</p>

<p>The polyps reproduce by budding and by self-division (fission),
in a manner similar to that of sea-anemones. The way in which
the budding or the fission takes place determines the shape of
the colony, or corallum, which has a great variety of forms. In
some species the budding is confined to certain individuals of the
colony. In this case the branched forms result. When growth
takes place by fission, hemispherical masses are formed, which
are often perfectly symmetrical, as in the so-called brain-corals.
In <em class="e000I2">Astræa</em> the polyps are inclosed separately, but in <em class="e000I2">Meandrina</em>
fission is confined to the upper half of the polyps, so that a complex
polyp is formed, with several mouths opening into a common
stomach, making long serpentine furrows on the corallum.</p>

<p>Some of the genera of the second subdivision, the alcyonarians,
differ materially from the ordinary idea of corals, as their framework
is of a horny and more or less flexible material (chitin).
Of these are the sea-fans, sea-whips, and sea-pens. The organ-pipe
coral of the same subdivision is an example of an exceedingly
fragile lime structure, while the red coral, <em class="e000I2">Corallina rubrum</em>, <a id="pg147"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg147]</span>
the species so much used for ornamental purposes, has an exceedingly
hard and stony character. The madrepore corals are called
reef-builders, but not in the sense of constructors of reefs. They
do not erect definite structures as bees do. It is the aggregation
of the skeletons of the dead polyps, together with other agencies,
which forms a reef. The coral polyps, though so minute individually,
are almost infinite in numbers. It is estimated that the
colonies rise one half of an inch in ten years.</p>

<p>Corals live at different depths in the sea. Those which form
the base of the reef are the astræans, which do not live above a
depth of six fathoms. They are characterized by little star-shaped
spots on the corallum, the radial partitions meeting in the center
of the spots, or corallites. Next above the astræans come the
mæandrinas and the porites. The former have elongated openings
which extend in waving furrows over the surface. The porites
resemble astræans, but the pits are smaller, with fewer partitions,
and the substance is more porous. Above these and capping
the reefs are the beautiful branching and palmate madreporians,
together with millepores, numerous varieties of sea-fans (<em class="e000I2">Gorgonacea</em>),
and the calcareous seaweeds (nullipores), making a
garden of beautiful branching forms of every shape and color.</p>

<p>The coral reef is as thickly inhabited by other living organisms
as is the forest by birds and insects. Mollusks, worms, crabs,
starfishes, and sea-urchins find resting-places there and work
destruction to the coral masses, as they bore and penetrate the
reef in various ways until large fragments of it are detached and
either washed by the waves to places far from their foundation,
or ground to sand, which, filling the interstices of the reef, adds
to its solidity.</p>

<p>The living coral is quite different in appearance from the
bleached skeletons commonly seen. The surface of the corallum
is often soft and downy, from the numerous waving tentacles,
and its coloring is vivid and varied. The madrepores are pink,
yellow, green, brown, and purple. <em class="e000I2">Tubipora</em>, the organ-pipe coral,
has green polyps emanating from its red tubes. White polyps in
star-like form dot the branches of the red coral of commerce,
<em class="e000I2">Corallina rubrum</em>. The whole mass of <em class="e000I2">Helipora</em> is bright blue, <a id="pg148"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg148]</span>
and the beautiful sea-pens are both highly colored and phosphorescent.
Owing to the fact that these brilliantly colored
polyps were mistaken for blossoms, the recognition of their true
character was long delayed, they having been ranked as vegetables
until comparatively recent times.</p>

<p>With few exceptions, corals do not grow in water below the
temperature of 68°, hence they are inhabitants of tropical and
subtropical waters. The Florida Keys are coral reefs, and the
species described below are to be found there.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Oculina</em></p>

<p>Arborescent; corallites arranged somewhat spirally on branches
and widely separated; branches compact between corallites.
Each bud is for a time at the apex of the branch, but finally becomes
lateral, and then gives off another bud from its upper surface,
and so the stem lengthens. (<a href="#Plate-XLIV">Plate XLIV.</a>)</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Astræa</em></p>

<p>The star-corals. The corals of this genus are hemispherical
masses covered with small star-shaped pits, or corallites. Although
the diameter of an astræa-dome may be twelve feet or more,
it has only one half or three quarters of an inch of living coral
on its surface, the rest being solid matter left behind as the
polyps rose in growth. The colony increases by self-division.
The septa meet in the center of the corallite, making star-like
pits; the surface is comparatively smooth. (<a href="#Plate-XLIV">Plate XLIV.</a>)</p>

<p class="genushead">Genera <em class="eB00I2">Meandrina</em>, <em class="eB00I2">Diploria</em></p>

<p>Corallum massive, hemispherical in shape, with furrows running
in irregular lines over the whole surface. The peculiar serpentine

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. cerebriformis.</em> This species is commonly known as brain-coral
or brain-stone. The hemispherical shape, together with the peculiar

<p>Some species of these corals appear like branches, while others
have flat, low surfaces or fronds; all of them are covered with
innumerable small cylindrical cups. Each cup is the home of a
polyp, which secretes calcareous matter around its column, and
septa between its radial partitions. The corallum, when examined
with a glass, looks like meshwork. Through the fine
openings of the porous surface, the polyps of the colony are
connected by interlacing tubes of animal substance (cœnosarc).
The polyps of the madrepore colonies are small in comparison
with the connecting structure, which becomes very massive; but,
although large, the corallum is fragile, on account of its perforated
character and the exceeding delicacy of its parts.</p>

<p>In species which form incrustations, new polyps arise from
tissue which spreads beyond the corallites. In some species certain
polyps and corallites increase in length, growing longitudinally,
and continually form buds around the base. This manner
of growth leads to the formation of branches, while the former
manner gives lateral extension. Both of these forms of budding
may take place at the same time in the same colony. The madrepores
are among the most common of the reef-builders. They
form reefs which extend for miles around the Florida Keys.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. cervicornis</em>, the stag-horn coral. This is a branching species
which attains large size. Its manner of growth is as follows: At the tip
of each branch is an individual polyp, which is larger than those which
surround the branch. This is the original animal which started the
branch, and is the parent from which all the others on the branch have
budded. The large terminal polyp buds around the base; a surplus of
lime also collects at the base and clogs its tissues, so that it no longer
can perform the functions of life, and after a certain period the base
becomes dead matter. The polyp on the upper end continues to live
and rises above the excess of solid matter. At the same time it continues
to form new buds. The buds become independent corallites and
secrete an excess of calcareous matter at their bases, which cements them
to the parent stock and increases the thickness of the branch. Thus, as
the original polyp constantly rises and buds, the colony assumes a stem-like
form, covered with numerous individuals. Certain polyps on the
main stem have the attributes of the parent animal. These start
branches, and so the process goes on, and in time the colony becomes
much branched and arborescent in form. In the living coral each little
polyp is like a minute sea-anemone, having a colored cylindrical body
surrounded on its upper disk with numerous tentacles. (<a href="#Plate-XLV">Plate XLV.</a>)
<a id="pg150"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg150]</span></p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. palmata.</em> This madrepore grows like the one described above,
except that the branches do not remain separated, but unite or grow
together, giving broad, flat surfaces which resemble fronds. When
carefully examined these surfaces show striations which indicate the
course of the branches. The structures forming the lobes are caused by
the failure of the branches to unite. On the Carysfort Reef of the
Florida Keys this species covers the top of the reef for several miles,
nearly reaching the surface, and appears like a vast bed of low yellow
shrubbery. (<a href="#Plate-XLV">Plate XLV.</a>)</p></div>

<p>In this subclass—the

The smaller are without

radial partitions and
eight tentacles. This
limitation of parts places
them in a higher rank
than the corals of the

characteristic of these
polyps is the presence
of symmetrical branchlets
on the tentacles,
which give them a
feather-like appearance.
These corals are called
halcyonoids. <a id="pg151"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg151]</span></p>

<p>The organ-pipe coral. This genus, which is deep red in color
and very fragile, consists of many tubes slightly separated from
 <a id="pg152"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg152]</span>
one another, but connected by horizontal platforms at short intervals.
The form of reproduction, by budding, in this colony is
peculiar to itself. The spicules of lime secreted in the polyp
unite or fuse into a tube or cylindrical skeleton. At certain
stages of development the polyp sends out a horizontal expansion,
which unites with the expansions of other polyps and becomes
calcified, forming a shelf which binds the tubes together.
From the top of the platforms other corallites are formed, and
thus a colony is made, which broadens as it rises in its growth.
The body of the polyp is green, the skeleton red. It belongs to
the East Indian seas and is given here only as an example of a
peculiar manner of growth.</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">GORGONACEA</em><span class="smaller">
SEA-FANS, SEA-WHIPS, AND SEA-FEATHERS</span></h6>

<p>These are compound, tree-like <em class="e000I2">Alcyonaria</em>, with a calcareous or
horny skeleton which forms a branched axis and is covered with a
layer of united polyps having spicules of lime distributed through
the mass, which give some firmness to the bark-like covering.
Gorgonias, in great variety, grow in abundance on the coral reefs
and mud-flats of Florida, forming masses of low shrubbery, pink,
yellow, brown, or purple in color.</p>

<p>The sea-whips and sea-feathers are varieties of gorgonias,
which are named from their forms. Some have shapes which
resemble branching shrubs; others are long unbranched rods,
either straight or spiral. They attain a height of several feet and
are of various colors. The colony has a horny axis surrounded
by a living mass which resembles a sheet of animal matter. This
mass consists of polyps closely united, and has throughout its substance
spicules of carbonate of lime, making it a kind of calcareous
crust or bark. In dried specimens this becomes very brittle,
and is easily broken from the horny axis. (<a href="#Plate-XLVI">Plates XLVI</a>,

<p>The sea-fans are colonies with a central, horny, flexible, and
much-branched axis, covered, as in the sea-whips, with a layer of
united polyps containing spicules of lime, which make a somewhat
<a id="pg153"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg153]</span> firm crust. This, in dried specimens, breaks off readily.
The colony branches profusely, or rather separates by fission, in
one plane, the large and small branches making a network of
fan-like shape and often of great fineness and intricacy. These
fans attain a length of several feet and a corresponding breadth,
and are abundant in semi-tropical as well as in more southern
waters. In color they are red, yellow, brown, or purple.</p>

SEA-PENS</span></h6>

<p>These singular colonies resemble quill-feathers, such as are
used for pens, and are named for this reason. The long, horny
central axis is naked below, and is partly buried in the sand, but
is not permanently attached. The upper portion of the axis has
two rows of short, opposite, lateral branches; on the upper side
of the branches the polyps live in separate inclosures. Spicules
of lime are present in the substance of the branches, which gives
them stability. Sea-pens are found at moderate depths and are
widely distributed. They are highly colored and phosphorescent. <a id="pg154"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg154]</span></p>

 COMB-JELLIES</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>These are delicate, free-swimming, generally spherical
bodies, resembling jellyfishes in outline, transparency, and
gelatinous consistency, but differing from them widely in the
manner of locomotion. They are called "comb-jellies" from
the rows of flat cilia, arranged like the teeth of a comb, which
run in eight meridional lines over the surface. It is by means of
these cilia that the animal moves through the water. The little
paddles are worked in unison, in single lines, or each one of them
can be moved independently, and they give the animal varying
and peculiar motions. The <em class="e000I2">Ctenophora</em>
are nearly transparent,
but have a prismatic coloring, caused by the waving cilia, and at
night they are phosphorescent. They are widely distributed,
being found in all seas.</p>

<p>The mouth of the animal opens into a gullet which extends
two thirds through the length of the body. On each side of the
gullet is a vertical tube. The two tubes unite at the base of the
gullet, and from there run as a single canal to the end opposite
the mouth, and open to the outside through two excretory pores.
From the base of the gullet, where the tubes unite, two other
tubes extend laterally, which divide and subdivide in a horizontal
plane, becoming eight in number, and connect at the surface with
the lines of cilia; then, dividing, run in opposite directions to the
poles of the spherical body. The animal derives its nourishment
and air through this circulatory system. A nervous system is
situated at the pole opposite the mouth, in a small area surrounded
by cilia, in the center is an eye-speck, or lithocyst. <a id="pg156"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg156]</span></p>

Like other jellyfishes, their part in life is finished
when they have discharged their spawn, and the
first September storms break them to pieces. In July
and August they are plentiful on the New England
coast. They appear at the surface of the water in
the hottest part of the day, but disappear entirely
when the water is in the least rough or the weather is
cold or the sun overcast. Their movements are slow
and graceful, the long axis being carried in a nearly
horizontal position. They are exceedingly voracious,
feeding chiefly on other <em class="e000I2">Ctenophora</em>, and often swallowing
animals as large as themselves.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">I. cyanthina.</em> This species, found on the northern

<h4 title="Worms"><a id="pg163"></a>WORMS</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>Burrowing in sand and mud, lying under stones and in
crevices of rocks, concealed in various kinds of tubular cases
which are free or attached to stones or shells, crawling over the
ground or seaweeds, swimming free or attached to other animals,
is found in abundance a class of animals commonly known
as "worms," and generally regarded as repulsive creatures unworthy
of attention.</p>

<p>To the biologist, however, worms are among the most interesting
forms of lower animal life. The amateur collector, if he
stops to give them careful consideration, will probably find them
unexpectedly interesting, and will be surprised to find how many
varieties of them there are, and how different they are from his
preconceived notion of them. Worms are varied in structure,
their habits are strange, and their form and color often beautiful.
Although plentiful, they are not conspicuous, but are easily found
if search is made for them, and so large a class of shore animals
should not be passed by unnoticed. Unusual biological interest
is attached to this group because, in the different types, affinities
with other classes of animals are found, suggesting, perhaps,
connecting-links with higher organizations. They are the first
animals to show definite bilateral symmetry, or two similar sides,
and to carry the same part of the body always in front. Formerly
one division, called <em class="e000I2">Vermes</em>, comprised all the worms. To-day they
are separated into four divisions, or phyla. The most careless
observer easily recognizes the basis of separation, for the flatworms,
the round-&#160;or threadworms, the wheel-like animalcules,
and the jointed worms have very obvious differences. The names
given the phyla express these distinctions, the termination <a id="pg164"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg164]</span>
meaning "worm"; the prefixes <em class="e000I2">Platy-</em>, <em class="e000I2">Nemat-</em>, <em class="e000I2">Troc-</em>, meaning
"flat," "thread," "wheel," respectively; while <em class="e000I2">Annulata</em>, meaning
"ringed," describes the segmented forms belonging to that
phylum.</p>

<p>There are vast numbers of parasitic worms, which live internally
or externally on their hosts, there being no animal of land
or sea, of high or low degree, which is not subject to the affliction
of these visitors. The parasitic worms are degenerate, some
being without digestive organs, or without eyes, or without locomotor
organs, and so on, as the case may be, the host supplying
the missing function. The life-history of these low forms
is interesting; but parasitic worms do not come within the scope
of this book, and are mentioned only to mark their place in the
series.</p>

<h4 title="Phylum Platyhelminthes">PHYLUM <em
class="eBU001">PLATYHELMINTHES</em> <span
class="smaller">FLATWORMS</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The flatworms have a flattened body, more or less compressed
in the different classes. Ordinarily the body is very thin, and,
when short, has a leaf-like form; when long it is ribbon-like.
Some species are thick in the middle and thin at the edges. They
have a dorsal, or upper, and a ventral, or under, surface; a right
and a left side; an anterior and a posterior end. The anterior
end is carried forward and has some of the characteristics of a
head, though a distinct head is not apparent. The mouth is on
the ventral surface. In some species it is in the middle of the
length of the body; in others it is before or behind this point.</p>

<p>The flatworms are the first animals to assume pronounced
bilateral symmetry. They are soft-bodied, having no supporting
skeleton, and they have no segments, or divisions, such as are
found in higher types, as in <em class="e000I2">Annulata</em>. They have no body-cavity,
the space between the organs and the body-wall being filled with
tissue. The alimentary canal has no anal aperture, the excretions
being carried off by a water-vascular system consisting of branching
vessels which end in minute bundles of vibrating cilia, called
ciliary flames. These flames communicate with the exterior
through small pores or flame-cells. Their sense-organs are eyes <a id="pg165"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg165]</span>
and otocysts. The latter are sacs containing crystals of carbonate
of lime, and their function is supposed to be that of hearing.</p>

<p>The flatworms are hermaphroditic, and their propagation is by
means of eggs. They are numerous and very generally distributed,
occurring in fresh and salt water, on land and shore, on
the surface and in the depths of the sea. A vast number also are
parasites and infest, internally or externally, nearly every living
creature. The parasitic forms differ anatomically from the free-living
worms. The internal parasites, living by absorption of the
digested food of their hosts, have no digestive organs; they are
also devoid of organs of sense and of defense. The external
parasites, being carried about by their hosts, are without organs
of locomotion.</p>

<h5>CLASS <em class="eBU001">TURBELLARIA</em></h5>

<p>The turbellarians are the simplest group of bilateral animals
and occupy the lowest place among worms. They owe their
name to the fact that they are covered with cilia, which are constantly
in motion and cause a slight turbulence in the water
around them.</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">POLYCLADIDA</em>
<span class="smaller">
("<em class="e000I2">Many-branched</em>")</span></h6>

<p>The polyclads are found below half-tide mark on the under side
of stones and on seaweeds. Sometimes they are found swimming
about at night. They are leaf-like in form, one inch to two inches
in length, and are very thin and delicate. They adapt themselves
to the inequalities of the surfaces to which they attach themselves,
and often are of the same color, and therefore are so inconspicuous
that they are apt to escape notice. They move with a
gliding motion over surfaces, and often swim when in search of
food.</p>

<p>The intestine is much branched and has no anal aperture.
From the mouth, which is placed in the center of the ventral surface,
a pharynx, or muscular fold, is protruded in some species,
which enables the worm to attach itself to and consume prey of
considerable size.   After digestion has taken place, the fecal <a id="pg166"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg166]</span>
matter collects in the main intestine and is forcibly ejected by
the pharynx. Numerous eyes are collected in groups on the
anterior dorsal surface, or arranged around the margin of the
body. The eggs are laid in shell-like cases, and cemented
together in plate-like masses or in spirals, and attached to shells
or stones. (<a href="#Plate-XLVIII">Plate XLVIII.</a>)</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">TRICLADIDA</em><span class="smaller">
("<em class="e000I2">Three-branched</em>")</span></h6>

<p>The triclads are divided into three groups: those of the fresh-water
ponds and streams, those of the land and sea, known as
planarians, and those of the sea. The planarians are the most
interesting worms in the order. The triclads differ from the
polyclads in being elongate in form and in having the intestine
in three branches instead of in many. The mouth is midway in
the length of the body, on the ventral side, and from it protrudes
a pharynx, which is cylindrical or bell-shaped, and is capable of
great dilatation. With the pharynx the worm, which is wholly
carnivorous, envelops other worms, crustaceans, or any animal
food. Several species are found on the under side of stones in
tide-pools.</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">RHABDOCŒLIDA</em></h6>

<p>Minute, active worms found among the red seaweeds. They
are brown in color, and are marked by one or more transverse
white bars.</p>

<h5>CLASS <em class="eBU001">NEMERTINEA</em></h5>

<p>The nemerteans are long, narrow, flat, smooth worms, and
vary from one half of an inch to many feet in length. They are
exceedingly contractile, and when alarmed can shrink to less than
half their normal length. They are very generally distributed,
and are to be found between tide-marks, in loose coils like a
string, under stones on sandy and muddy shores. The very
long species, like <em class="e000I2">Lineus marinus</em>, are solitary, but other smaller
species are gregarious, many worms being coiled together in
tangled masses. Some species are to be found in empty shells,
and others live among the seaweeds. They are very slimy, the
epidermis secreting an abundance of mucus, and they can often
be tracked by the trail of slime they leave behind them. This
mucus sometimes hardens, forming for some species a tubular
<a id="pg168"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg168]</span> covering; others remain naked. All are covered with vibrating
cilia, which is a universal feature of flatworms. In color
they may be white, yellow, green, red, purple, etc., and sometimes
they are banded or striped with a contrasting color. The
ventral is usually lighter than the dorsal surface.</p>

<p>The principal characteristic of the nemertean worms is a long
thread-like organ, known as the <em class="e000I2">proboscis</em>. This lies in a sheath
along the center of the dorsal surface, and is quickly thrown
out to a great length, and as quickly completely withdrawn within
the body. The proboscis is slender, hollow, muscular, and full
of nerves. It reaches the outside through a pore at the anterior
end of the body, and has no connection with the alimentary
system. It is used as a feeler and as a weapon. Some
species have a sharp spine at the end of the proboscis, others
have stinging-cells. The proboscis is sometimes so forcibly
ejected that it breaks off, in which case it retains its vitality for
some time, and seems as if it were itself a worm. A new proboscis
is quickly grown by the worm to take the place of a lost
one. The head is a little broader than the body, and has eyes
arranged in one or several pairs on each side. The mouth is on
the ventral surface, near the anterior end, has thick lips, and is
very dilatable. Through the mouth the animal ejects a part of
the esophagus and envelops its prey, which is often of considerable
size. Chætopod worms they often swallow whole; the soft
parts, after being digested, are carried off through the regular
passages, ending in the ciliary flames (<a href="#pg164">page 164</a>), while the indigestible
parts are ejected at the anus. Often the spines and
bristles find their way out by perforating the intestine and the
body-wall, without apparently doing the worm any injury. The
perforated parts quickly heal.</p>

<p>These worms have the strange power of regenerating lost parts;
mutilated portions are soon repaired. The anterior end, when
severed from the rest of the body, grows again into a complete
individual, while the posterior end continues to perform part of
its functions and retains its vitality for a considerable time before
dying. One species, <em class="e000I2">Lineus sanguineus</em>, is capable, after being
broken in pieces, of regenerating each section into a perfect worm. <a id="pg169"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg169]</span></p>

<p>The nemerteans are carnivorous, voracious, and often cannibalistic.
They will live for some time in confinement, losing, however,
their bright color, and the smaller worms will gradually disappear,
as they are devoured by the larger ones. The mode of
locomotion varies with the order. Some species attach their long
proboscis to a distant object, then drag the body to it; some glide
rapidly along by means of the muscles of the body and the cilia
which cover it; others swim. The swimming forms have thin
edges which have a wave-like motion, and this, together with a
lateral movement of the tail, propels them through the water.
In some species the worm develops directly from the egg; others
pass through a larval stage before reaching maturity.</p>

extended, but can contract to two or three feet in length, and are then

with great rapidity. Its head changes shape constantly and assists the

<p>The worms of this phylum have the general name of roundworms,
which distinguishes them from the flatworms of the preceding
division and from the segmented worms of the <em class="e000I2">Annulata</em>.
The body is elongated, cylindrical, smooth, and pointed at both

SEGMENTED WORMS</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The name of this phylum expresses the principal characteristic
of the group of worms which have elongated bodies composed
of series of short parts, or ring-like divisions. Each one of these
segments contains a separate and similar set of internal organs. <a id="pg171"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg171]</span></p>

<p>The annelids are divided into four classes, one of which, the
<em class="e000I2">Gephyrea</em>, has not the characteristics which distinguish the group.
The classes are easily recognized by conspicuous features. Some
have bristles; others have scales; others have tentacles around
the head and inclose themselves in tubes. Many are highly
colored, and all are of great interest to the naturalist from the
diversity of their habits, form, and structure, and from the analogies
they bear to other and higher types of animals.</p>

<p>The annelids are the highest type of worms, their organs
having attained more special functions. The sense-organs of eye
and ear are more developed, and the nervous system has distinct
centers, or ganglia, the first and largest ganglion being a part of
the head. They are found in abundance everywhere. Some
species grow to the length of one foot or two feet. Some are
carnivorous, others vegetarian, and many are mud-eaters, swallowing
sand and mud for the sake of the organisms they contain.
They themselves are food for fishes, which devour them
in vast quantities, rooting them out of their burrows or capturing
them at night, at which time they swim about.</p>

 class="e000I2">vent. cirr.</em>, ventral cirrus; <em
 class="e000I2">s</em>, setæ.</div>
</div>

<p>The bristle-worms. This class of worms has bunches of bristles
on both sides of each segment of the body, which serve as organs
of locomotion, or bristle-feet.
The bristles emanate from
outgrowths of the body
known as <em class="e000I2">parapodia</em>, which
are practically limbs. The
parapodia are sometimes
divided into distinct lobes
or branches. The bristles
are of various shapes and
often of brilliant color. They
are usually horny, sometimes
simple, sometimes divided into joints, and vary in shape in different
genera.  The parapodia have, besides the bristles, a second set of <a id="pg172"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg172]</span>
hair-like appendages, called <em class="e000I2">cirri</em>. These are sense-organs and also
have a respiratory function. The cirri too vary in shape in different
genera. Generally they are hair-like, but sometimes conical;
again they are broadened into scales, as in the <em class="e000I2">Aphroditidæ</em>.</p>

<p>The body-cavity in chætopod worms is divided into a series of
chambers or segments. These divisions seem on the exterior like
constrictions, and give the body the appearance of a series of rings.
The internal organs are repeated in each segment, so that each of
the latter contains a portion of the alimentary canal, a pair of
<em class="e000I2">nephridia</em>, a pair of nerve-ganglia, and blood-vessels which connect
the main blood-vessels running along the dorsal and ventral surfaces.
The alimentary canal runs through the body, but is constricted
at each joint. The nephridia are curved tubes, which
are excretory organs, opening to the outside and carrying off
the waste products which have passed into the fluid of the body-cavity.</p>

<p>The chætopod worms have a well-developed nervous system,
beginning with a two-lobed ganglion forming a brain and head,
then extending through the worm in a double ventral chain and
series of ganglia. They have also a blood-vascular system. The
blood is either colored or colorless. Sometimes it is a bright red
or green, and is often visible through the body-wall. The circulation
is effected, not by means of a heart, but by wave-like (peristaltic)
contractions of the dorsal blood-vessel. The body is cylindrical,
but in many cases is somewhat flattened. There are two
layers of muscles, one of which encircles the body, while the other
extends parallel with its length. Respiration is effected by <em class="e000I2">gills</em>,
which may be simple, hair-like appendages to the parapodia, or
branched, or comb-like in form. Sometimes they are confined
to the middle segments, as in <em class="e000I2">Arenicola</em>; sometimes to the segments
near the head, as in <em class="e000I2">Tubicola</em>; or they may be extended
over the whole dorsal surface.</p>

of species of this class of worms, the species being based on the
shape and the lobes of the parapodia, the relative length of the cirri,
the form and arrangement of the chætæ, and so on. They are
abundant on the shore everywhere, but abound where rocks and
stones afford them some shelter. Many burrow in the sand and
mud. In doing this the worm eats his way into the hole, swallowing
the mud and sand. He assimilates the organic or vegetable
matter the mud contains, and ejects the rest in cylindrical
coils, known as castings, which lie in heaps at the mouth of the burrow.
By these castings they may be traced. Others secrete tubes.</p>

<p>The polychæte worms are divided into <em class="e000I2">Errantia</em>, which are
wandering, free-swimming forms, and <em class="e000I2">Sedentaria</em> or <em class="e000I2">Tubicola</em>,
which live in tubes permanently. These distinctions are not
strictly correct, since some species of errant polychætes form
tubes (<em class="e000I2">Eunicidæ</em>), and some <em class="e000I2">Sedentaria</em> form no tubes.</p>

<p>Many polychætes are beautifully colored, some in vivid reds
and greens, with various markings; some are iridescent; some
are phosphorescent.</p>

many are minute. They are often highly colored. Many have
long cirri on the feet; some have alternation of generation.
They are common everywhere along the coast, but are not seen
unless searched for. Sponges sometimes are alive with them.

<p>The scale-bearing annelids. This family of worms is distinguished
from all others by having scales on the back. The scales,
called <em class="e000I2">elytra</em>, are flattened dorsal cirri carried on the upper parapodia, <a id="pg174"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg174]</span>
and generally on alternate segments and in a double row
down the back. The elytra are the breathing-organs, and, although
of a horny texture, are richly supplied with nerves. The worms
are short and have a large protrusible pharynx armed with a
double pair of horny jaws.</p>

<p>The species of <em class="e000I2">Polynoë</em> are determined by the
number of scales they bear. They have a flattened
short body with nearly parallel sides. The bristles
are of a bright golden color. The proboscis is large
and has four powerful jaws at the end and a circle of
papillæ at the top. They are sluggish in movement
and are found under stones and in the crevices of rocks.
When disturbed they roll themselves into a ball.</p>

which they use in locomotion.
The head is long and bears four

feet in length, usually eight to
twelve inches long. The general
color is bright green and iridescent.
Found in tide-pools. Specimens
are often found by digging

obtained by placing old shells
and other material in a dish of
sea-water. When the water becomes
a little stale, the worms of
this and other families make their
way to the sides of the dish, where
they secrete a colorless slime
which holds mud or any light
matter that it may come in contact
with. In this condition, when lifted or disturbed, they crawl
rapidly out of the slime, and show to good advantage their elongate
body, which is often beautifully colored.</p>

</div>

<p>Among the most common of the polychæte worms is the genus
<em class="eB00I2">Nereis</em>, various species of which are found in all parts of the
world. They are abundant under stones, among seaweeds, and
living in burrows between tide-marks. They are active, fierce,
and voracious. Some attain a length of eighteen or more inches.
They are commonly known as "clam-worms,"
and are used by fishermen for bait. <em class="e000I2">Nereis</em>
has a distinct head, consisting of two parts.
One, the <em class="e000I2">prostomium</em>, bears on its upper side
four eyes and a pair of short, conical tentacles,
and on the lateral sides a second pair of processes
called <em class="e000I2">palps</em>. The palps are more conspicuous
than the tentacles, and consist of
two parts, a large base and a small terminal point, the latter
capable of being withdrawn. The palps are sense-organs and
perhaps test the food. The second part of the head, or <em class="e000I2">peristomium</em>,
bears on the sides four pairs of long tentacles which are
used as feelers. The mouth is on the ventral side, and through it
<em class="e000I2">Nereis</em> throws out its pharynx, which contains a horny, notched
jaw. It seizes its prey with this jaw, which, with the pharynx,
is then withdrawn and tears the food apart, acting like a gizzard.
The body of <em class="e000I2">Nereis</em> is rounded above and nearly flat below. Each
of the segments has a pair of parapodia, bearing a bundle of bristles
and cirri. The last segment of the body is elongated, cylindrical,
and without parapodia, but has on the end a pair of long
cirri, which give the appearance of a divided tail. Each segment
of the body, except the head-&#160;and tail-segments, contains a pair
of excretory tubes (<em class="e000I2">nephridia</em>), ganglia of nerves, and a portion of
the intestine and of the vascular system. There are circular
muscles by which the worm can diminish its diameter, longitudinal <a id="pg177"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg177]</span>
muscles in four bands, and muscles to
move the parapodia. Breathing is carried on
over the whole surface of the body, and especially
in parts of the lobes of the parapodia
called gills. Its sense-organs are eyes, palps,
tentacles, and cirri.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. virens.</em> This species is found from New
York northward in muddy and shelly sand, and
under rocks between tide-marks, living in burrows,
which it lines with a mucous secretion. It is very
active, and voracious, feeding on other worms,
<em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>, etc., which it captures with its horny,
protruded jaw. At night it leaves its burrow and
swims freely about like an eel, frequently falling
a prey to fishes. In color it is dull bluish-green,
with some iridescence. The gills, which are leaf-like
appendages on the parapodia, are green on
the anterior end of the body and become bright
red farther back. This species, and <em class="e000I2">N. branti</em> of
Alaska, are the giants of polychæte worms, often
measuring eighteen inches or more in length.</p></div>

<p>Many of this order construct tubes in which they

and <em class="e000I2">Errantia</em> have habits pertaining to the other.
These worms are without a protrusible pharynx and
without jaws. The body is usually divided into two
or three sections by segments and appendages of different
forms. They have hair-setæ on a limited
number of segments only, varying with the species;
the remaining segments have <em class="e000I2">uncini</em>, or hooked comb-like
rows of setæ, which are very small, but often
crowded in bunches. Uncini exist also on segments
having hair-setæ. Parapodia are often lacking on
the posterior parts and are usually without cirri.
The gills are usually confined to the anterior end and
are sometimes represented by tentacles around the
head. The different species have characteristic tubes,
formed by mucus secreted by epidermal glands.
Sometimes the mucus hardens, making a parchment-like
tube; again it cements together grains of sand,
or bits of shell, seaweeds, etc. Some species secrete <a id="pg181"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg181]</span>

has bunches of golden bristles arranged in two rows close to the
flattened anterior end, which make a kind of operculum to the

<h5>CLASS <em class="eBU001">GEPHYREA</em></h5>

<p>This class of animals, once placed near the holothurians, belongs
with the annelid worms on account of their mode of development,
their structure being entirely dissimilar. They are
without segments and without parapodia. The body-cavity is
filled with fluid and is traversed by connective tissue and fine
muscular fibers. They are subcylindrical animals which can
retract the anterior end of the body. The mouth is surrounded
by tentacles, or by tentacular folds, and is at the base of the
proboscis. They live in fissures of rocks, in sand, mud, rock, or
coral, and in deep gasteropod shells. Their distribution is general.</p>

<h6>ORDER <em class="eBU001">SIPUNCULOIDEA</em></h6>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Sipunculus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. nudus.</em> The body is cylindrical, a foot or more in length when
extended. It is divided into two portions. The anterior end, to the
<a id="pg186"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg186]</span> extent of one sixth of the entire length of the worm, is capable of being
withdrawn into the remainder of the body. This portion is called the
<em class="e000I2">introvert</em>. The introvert is retracted by means of special muscles forming
a sheath around the gullet and connected at the other end to the
body-wall about half-way down the body. It is narrower than the rest
of the body and is covered more or less closely with small horny papillæ
which turn backward and overlap like scales. The rest of the body is
divided into longitudinal furrows and circular markings, giving it the appearance
of being divided into squares. These markings correspond to
muscles which lie beneath. The introvert, when retracted, leaves at the
opening a lobed and plaited fold of the integument, giving the appearance
of tentacles. When the introvert is expanded there is a fringe-like
funnel around the mouth. The body is covered with a horny cuticle
and has an iridescent luster. The animal lives buried in the sand and
feeds upon sand, deriving its nourishment from the organisms contained
therein. The sipunculoids pass so much sand and mud through their
bodies that they are said to modify the mineral substances on the bottom
of the sea, as earthworms do the soil of the land.</p></div>

<h4 title="Polyzoa">POLYZOA</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>Among the numerous objects to be found on the beach at
low tide are the <em class="e000I2">Polyzoa</em>, of which there are said to be seventeen
hundred named species of the marine forms. These little
animals, although so plentiful, are inconspicuous, and it may be
said that their very existence is not known to those who are not
professed naturalists; yet they are easy to see, incrusting with a
delicate calcareous lacework the surface of stones and shells and
seaweeds in the tide-pools, and hanging from the rocks like
branches of delicate seaweeds. There is hardly a frond of even
the fine red algæ on which cannot be found the little tube holding
shelly saucers, or the creeping stems or branches of polyzoans.
Any one of these little masses, when examined with a pocket-glass,
will surprise one with its delicate and beautiful structure.</p>

<p>This class of animals is also called <em class="e000I2">Bryozoa</em>, and certain species
have the common names of sea-mats and corallines. They are
broadly divided into two groups, namely, the erect and the incrusting
forms. Those having tree-&#160;or plant-like shapes resemble
seaweeds, while the colonies which spread over stones, shells, and
algæ resemble moss, hence the name <em class="e000I2">Bryozoa</em> (moss-animals).
Both groups have the general appearance of hydroids, because,
like them, they are colonies having plant forms and having
their organisms inclosed in cup-like sheaths. The resemblance,
however, is but a superficial one, for the <em class="e000I2">Polyzoa</em> have a much
higher organization, each animal of the colony being a separate
and distinct individual. They can easily be distinguished by the
hair-like processes on the tentacles. The ciliated tentacles and
complete alimentary system are the conspicuous differences between
these colonies and those of the hydroids.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Polyzoa</em> are very numerous and form a most attractive <a id="pg192"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg192]</span>
group. They are plentiful everywhere, occurring between tide-marks
and at great depths on the floor of the sea. Rocks protected
from the sun are often incrusted with the calcareous forms,
while branching species hang from the rocks and adorn rock
pools. <em class="e000I2">Membranipora</em>, in lace-like sheets, will be found on the
larger seaweeds as well as on various submerged objects. The
beautiful little <em class="e000I2">Crisia</em> may be looked for on the fronds of red
algæ, and <em class="e000I2">Alcyonidium</em>, in soft moss-like patches, on <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em>. On
some beaches are scattered the sea-mats, <em class="e000I2">Flustra foliacea</em>, looking
like bits of brown paper. A pocket-lens will reveal the marvelous
and orderly arrangement of the two layers of cells, or zoœcia,
placed back to back. There is not a more surprising object in
the animal kingdom than a living branch of <em class="e000I2">Bugula</em>. The cells
on its spiral, profusely branched clusters have appendages resembling
a bird's head, with its bill constantly opening and shutting.
Of the erect polyzoans some are entirely calcareous and
rigid; such species live in deep water, and their colonies are
called corallines, as are also the calcareous algæ. They have existed
in vast numbers since early geologic times, and are plentiful
in the Tertiary deposits, known as Coralline Crags. Other erect
forms have a calcareous framework, which is not continuous, but
has horny intervals, so that the colonies are flexible and can be
swayed by the tides in shallow water where they live. Others
have complete horny exoskeletons. The same differences occur
in the incrusting forms, those on the seaweeds being either flexible,
so that they bend with the plant, or if entirely calcareous
are so small that they do not break when the plant sways to and
fro. Still others are gelatinous and resemble bits of sponge.
The calcareous forms are usually ornamented with ridges which
form beautiful patterns.</p>

<p>The individuals of the polyzoan colonies are small polyp-like
organisms which have a cup-like inclosure of horny or of calcareous
substance, or of the two combined, as mentioned above.
This inclosing sheath is the exterior or cuticle of the animal and
is called the <em class="e000I2">zoœcium</em>, the whole colony being called the <em class="e000I2">zoarium</em>.
The animal substance within the zoœcium is the <em class="e000I2">polypide</em>, and
consists of the mouth, tentacles, and alimentary system. A disk
at the anterior end of the body, bearing the circle of tentacles, is <a id="pg193"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg193]</span>
the <em class="e000I2">lophophore</em>; it is a contractile body, being, with the tentacles,
protruded from the zoœcium or drawn within it at will. In
some species the orifices of the zoœcia are surrounded with spines;
others have lids, called <em class="e000I2">opercula</em>, which shut down when the polypides
are retracted. A singular modification of the zoœcia is
seen in the genus <em class="e000I2">Bugula</em>, where peculiar shapes like birds' heads,
called <em class="e000I2">avicularia</em>, occur. In these singular appendages the upper
beak is hooked, while the lower one, or mandible, is the operculum
of the zoœcium. These constantly open and shut by means of
muscles, and although their function is not certainly known, it is
thought that they capture prey. Other modifications are whip-like
processes, or flagellate filaments, called <em class="e000I2">vibracula</em>, which constantly
beat the water. In many of the zoœcia of the colony
there are dark-colored masses, called <em class="e000I2">brown bodies</em>. These are
formed by the degeneration of the polypides, which at certain
periods break down, their tentacles and alimentary system
ceasing to act and becoming brown masses. The body-wall then
puts out a bud internally and forms a new polypide, which absorbs,
or passes out, the brown body. The term of life of a single
polypide is not known, but in every colony many such transformations
are constantly taking place.</p>

<p>The colonies originally start from larvæ produced in the <em class="e000I2">ovicells</em>
of the zoaria. The ovicells are sometimes very large and
pear-shaped, occurring at intervals on the stems; or there may
be one at the top of each zoœcium. They look like pearls. A
larva, when liberated, swims about for a time, then attaches itself
to a fixed object, and increases, by budding, into some one of the
various forms which the colonies take.</p>

<h4 title="Echinodermata">ECHINODERMATA</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The echinoderms, although their shapes are very unlike in
the different classes, have the same general internal structure,
and also other features which place them together in one
group. They are radiates (<a href="#pg113">page 113</a>) of the highest type; they
have an exoskeleton; and many of them are beset with spines,
from which the name is given. They have locomotor organs, the
<em class="e000I2">ambulacra</em>, and a <em class="e000I2">water-vascular system</em> peculiar to themselves.
Some have the very strange power of casting off, and developing
again, parts of the body.</p>

<p>The development from the egg to the adult is remarkable, and
of unusual interest to naturalists. The larval stage of echinoderms
is so unlike the mature animal that for a long time the
larvæ were thought to be another class of animals, and therefore
were given the names which they still retain.</p>

<p>In observing echinoderms it will be seen that the dorsal part
is carried uppermost by some, such as the starfishes and sea-urchins.
In the former the back is broad and extended; in the
latter it is curved and contracted. But in crinoids the back is
carried downward and is extended like a stalk; in the sea-cucumbers
(holothurians) the dorsal and ventral surfaces are parallel
with the long axis of the cylindrical body, instead of being on a
plane with the mouth and excretory opening. Owing to the
unusual positions of the dorsal and ventral surfaces, the terms <em class="e000I2">oral</em>
(mouth side) and <em class="e000I2">aboral</em> (side opposite the mouth) are generally
used in describing these species.</p>

<p>The surface of the body is divided definitely by the ambulacra,
the <em class="e000I2">ambulacral zones</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">interambulacral spaces</em>, but differently
in the different classes. The movement of the animals is <a id="pg203"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg203]</span>
effected by means of the tube-feet, or ambulacra. These have
suckers, which are attached or released by the power of the water-vascular
system. The <em class="e000I2">madreporic plate</em>, which can be distinctly
seen in starfishes at the angle of two of the arms, is a calcareous
porous plate which opens into the <em class="e000I2">stone-canal</em>. This canal passes
through the body and opens into a circular tube which runs
around the mouth. A system of canals extends from this circumoral
tube, or <em class="e000I2">ring-canal</em>, and eventually one canal opens into
each tube-foot. Water, entering by the madreporic plate, passes
through the various canals and into the tube-feet, which it distends.
When the feet are pressed against a substance and the
water is withdrawn, a vacuum is formed, which causes the disk-ends
of the feet to act like suckers. When the feet are again
flooded the hold is relaxed. Thus the animal drags its body
along with a slow, gliding motion. The madreporic plate, being
calcareous, is said to act as a filter, purifying the water as it
passes into the body, which it furnishes with oxygen as well as
with locomotive power.</p>

</div>

<p>A curious organ found in the <em class="e000I2">Echinoidea</em> (sea-urchins) is called
<em class="e000I2">Aristotle's lantern</em>. It is a complicated arrangement, not fully
understood, having forty parts, and is connected with the alimentary
system. One of the parts is the mouth,
over which five teeth project. These teeth
grasp and grind the food. The exoskeleton
is composed of plates of carbonate of lime,
called <em class="e000I2">ossicles</em>, which cover the surface of the
body. The ossicles are of various sizes and
shapes, and are one of the determining features
in classification. They may be scattered
spicules of lime, separated plates joined by
connecting rods, or overlapping plates; or
they may be fitted together so as to form a
continuous shell. The starfishes are usually
carnivorous, the sea-urchins usually vegetarian, while the holothurians,
after the manner of worms, take in sand and mud, deriving
their nourishment from the organic particles contained in
them. All echinoderms live in the sea. <a id="pg204"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg204]</span></p>

THE STARFISHES</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>These animals are named from their star-shaped outline.
Some have five long, spreading arms diverging from a
small disk, which is hardly more than their point of union; others
have a large body with short arms, which are like angular projections
of the body, giving a pentagonal shape. Some genera have
a greater number of arms than others; <em class="e000I2">Solaster</em> has eleven to
thirteen, and <em class="e000I2">Heliaster</em> (the sun-stars, found on the west tropical
coast) has thirty to forty.</p>

 ampullæ; <em class="e000I2">f</em>, ambulacra.</div>
</div>

<p>The mouth of the starfish is in the center of the ventral side.
A ventral or <em class="e000I2">ambulacral groove</em> extends through each arm. In
these grooves the ambulacra, or tube-feet, are arranged in rows.
The <em class="e000I2">ambulacra</em> are hollow, cylindrical bodies, each of which has a
sucker at one end, and is connected at the other end with a little
globular body, the <em class="e000I2">ampulla</em>. The ventral groove forms a ridge in
the body-cavity. It is called the <em class="e000I2">ambulacral zone</em>, and is formed
by a double row of elongated plates, which meet and form a
raised line along the middle of the inside of the arms, and appear
like ribs; between them lie the ampullæ. These plates are called
the <em class="e000I2">ambulacral ossicles</em>. Numerous other ossicles extend over the
surface, buried in the integument of the body, making a calcareous
network, or <em class="e000I2">exoskeleton</em>. The ossicles are connected by muscles
so that the animal is not rigid, but is able to bend the body and
even creep through comparatively small places. The ossicles are
covered with <em class="e000I2">spines</em> of two kinds. The very minute ones are the
<em class="e000I2">pedicellariæ</em>, and have a jointed end which opens and shuts like a
pincers. Their principal use seems to be to remove waste matter
or other substances from the body, keeping it free and clean. The
pedicellariæ are arranged, in some species, in circles around the
<a id="pg206"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg206]</span> bases of the spines, and form groups over the dorsal surface.
Examining the backs of different starfishes with a strong magnifying-glass,
one will be surprised to see the varied grouping of
the spines and pedicellariæ. At the extremity of each arm is a
red eye-spot, which is sensitive to light, and a tube-foot, which has
no sucker and which is believed to
act both as an olfactory and as a
feeling organ. The madreporic plate
lies at the angle
of two of the
arms or rays.
Water filters through the
madreporic plate and
passes by the stone-canal
to the ring-canal around
the mouth, and thence to
the radial tubes, one of
which extends through
each arm and is connected
by a branch with each
tube-foot. At the base of
each tube-foot there is a
globular reservoir, or ampulla. A valve connects the tube-foot and
ampulla. When the ampulla is contracted, water is forced into and
distends the tube-foot; when the ampulla is distended, it withdraws
the water from the tube-foot, thus acting like a suction-bulb. When
water is sent into the tube-feet they are greatly extended and are then
placed against an object. The water being then withdrawn through
the ampullæ, a vacuum is formed, and the suckers are tightly attached.
By the alternating movements of the ambulacra the
animal is dragged slowly along and moves with a gliding motion.
It does not deviate from a straight path, going over elevations
or through depressions without turning aside; its body conforms
to the irregularities of the road and never bridges over
spaces. The stomach extends a little way into the arms, and a
short intestine leads to the excretory opening in the center of the
back. Starfishes are carnivorous and voracious, and are particularly
<a id="pg207"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg207]</span> destructive to oyster-beds. The animal fastens itself to a
bivalve, and protrudes a part of its stomach, with which it envelops
its prey and slowly sucks it out of its shell. When feeding
on small mollusks they take them into the stomach directly.
Starfishes regain by natural growth parts of the body which
may be lost. Sometimes the animal throws off an arm to escape
capture, and self-mutilation also occurs where unfavorable conditions
exist. Oystermen formerly were ignorant of the starfish's
wonderful powers of regeneration, and were in the habit
of cutting up those captured in their forks and throwing them
overboard, thus increasing the number instead of destroying their
enemies, as each arm with a piece of the body attached to it
will, it is said, become a new individual. This tenacity of life
makes starfishes difficult to destroy, and they are exceedingly
plentiful in all seas. One naturalist speaks of seeing on the
coast of Maine a bed of starfishes which extended several miles
and covered the bottom so closely that he picked sixty individuals
off a small stone. On the northern shores of the Pacific
coast they abound in great variety, and some are of unusual size.
<em class="e000I2">Asterias gigantea</em> of this region measures two feet across. Another
species, <em class="e000I2">Phyncopodia helianthoides</em>, measures a yard in diameter,
and has twenty or more arms. The most common species of the
Atlantic coast are <em class="e000I2">Asterias vulgaris</em> and <em class="e000I2">A. Forbesii</em>; the former
ranges from Long Island northward, the latter from Massachusetts
to Florida. These are the species particularly destructive
to oyster-beds. <em class="e000I2">Asterias vulgaris</em> sometimes grows to be fifteen
inches in diameter; from this, which is perhaps the largest, are
found starfishes of all sizes down to the very small <em class="e000I2">Cribrella</em>.
They inhabit all varieties of bottoms, from low-water mark to
deep water. They are not always abundant in the same place,
but seem to move about.</p>

<p>Some oystermen believe that the starfishes get into masses like
a ball and are rolled along by the tide. This idea comes from
the fact that an oyster-bed may be free from them one day and
the next be covered by these pests. To get rid of them the beds
are swept over with a tangle, which is an iron bar holding swabs
of raveled rope. The spines of the starfish are caught in the <a id="pg208"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg208]</span>
tangle, and often hundreds are brought up in one haul and are
then killed by steaming.</p>

<p>The anatomical system of the starfish is easily traced by cutting
off, with scissors, the skin from the dorsal surface of the
disk, and also cutting a slit down one of the arms. In the center
of the body will be seen the upper part of the stomach, a small
star-like spot, from which radiate five branches, which divide and
lead into the much-ramified, plume-like organs which extend
through the arms. These are the pyloric cæca, whose function is
to secrete the digestive fluids. The much-folded stomach occupies
the greater part of the central space, its large convolutions
showing on top. The mouth connects with the stomach on the
ventral side. By turning back the skin from the arm, small filiform
processes can in some large species be seen; these are the
dermal branchiæ, or breathing-organs, which may either project
through pores in the skin between the ossicles or be entirely retracted.
If the pyloric cæca be laid back, one can see the rib-like
arrangement of the ambulacral ossicles, and also the ampullæ,
which lie between the ossicles on each side of the ridge. If an
ampulla be inflated and then pressed, the corresponding tube-foot
will be seen to extend. To follow successfully the water-vascular
system, beginning in the madreporic plate and extending through
the stone-canal to the ring-canal around the mouth and thence
through the arms, requires a strong glass and more skilful manipulation.</p>

 BRITTLE-STARS</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The ophiurans, or brittle-stars, differ from the starfishes in
having the arms quite distinct from the body. In starfishes
the arms are extensions of the body, and the viscera extend partway
into them, while in ophiurans the body is a central disk, with
the five narrow arms attached to its margin. In form they suggest
a spider, and sometimes are called sea-spiders. The name
brittle-star is also descriptive, since they break off their limbs
readily. The arms are narrow, taper to a point, usually curl at
the ends, and have no ambulacral grooves, but are completely
covered with bare calcareous plates (except in the first order, where
they have a skin and no plates). The ambulacra are small spines
without suckers, which emanate from the sides or margins of the
arms and do not serve for walking. The madreporic plate is on
the ventral surface, in one of the circular shields which surround
the mouth. The alimentary canal ends blindly. The egg-sacs
lie between the arms and open by slits on the under side, close to
the arms, where they join the disk. Water flows in and out of
these pouches, which are thought to have also respiratory and
excretory functions. No eye-specks have been found, but they
must exist, since the animal is sensible to approaching danger and
quickly retreats. The ophiurans are more active than starfishes,
moving by wriggling, and clambering with their arms. They are
shy and hard to find, and it is difficult to capture a whole one,
since they throw off pieces of their arms at the least alarm. Often
they completely dismember themselves, an action which does them
no permanent injury, since they reproduce lost parts. They are
more commonly inhabitants of deep than of shallow waters, and
are brought up from the bottom in dredges in great numbers. <a id="pg215"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg215]</span>
Some species may be found near low-water mark under stones
and in clusters of mussels, and often in seaweeds, thrown up
from deep water, on the shore.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. Agassizii.</em> This very singular ophiuran is commonly called the
basket-fish, from its resemblance to a basket when the tentacles are
rolled up. Its body is covered with skin instead of calcareous plates.
The body is thick and somewhat circular in form, with elevated radiating
ridges on the upper side, and the skin is marked off in star-like
divisions. From the margin of the body extend five arms, which at
once divide in a forking manner; each section again divides, and this
division in pairs (dichotomous division) continues until the ends of the
arms have become very numerous and attenuated. The arms are carried
curled up or straight at will. In moving, the animal seems to walk on
these branches as if on tiptoe, and in this position it forms a kind of
net which entraps prey. The arms and prominent parts of the disk are
yellow, and the depressed or membranous parts brown. <em class="e000I2">Astrophyton</em> is
six to eighteen inches in diameter. It is found off the northern New
England coast.</p></div>

The upper surface of the body is covered with plates variously arranged,
sometimes in the shape of a star, and each one is surrounded with small
spines. The under side of the egg-sacs is covered with small spines.
These sacs open by slits on each side next the arms, and have a rounded
appearance, bulging out between the arms. The arms, which are long
and attenuated at the ends, have on the upper side transverse oval plates
surrounded by a border of flat, roundish granules. Sometimes the
plates are divided into two or three pieces, when they are similarly bordered
with granules. The arms are fringed with rows of thick, compressed,
obtuse spines, generally six in each row. The under sides of the
arms have large quadrangular plates slightly separated from one another
and extending across the whole surface in regular, even rows.

SEA-URCHINS</span></h5>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The shell of a sea-urchin consists of many calcareous plates,
or <em class="e000I2">ossicles</em>, fitted closely together and forming a continuous
exoskeleton. The plates are so united that externally the
marks of juncture are not perceptible, but on the interior the
shape of these plates is well defined. In examining such a shell,
or test (they abound on the beach), it will be seen that its surface
is covered with numerous hemispherical projections or knobs,
which are grouped in double rows and run in meridional lines
from one pole to the other of the more or less spherical body,
separating it into ten divisions. Five of these divisions have
perforations, or small pores in the plates of the shell, and are
called the <em class="e000I2">ambulacral zones</em> or areas, because through these pores
pass the small tubes, in the living animal, which connect the
tube-feet, or <em class="e000I2">ambulacra</em>, with the radial water-canals and the <em class="e000I2">ampullæ</em>
(see <a href="#pg206">page 206</a>). The wide spaces between these double
rows of pores are called the <em class="e000I2">interambulacral zones</em> or areas. The
ten spaces diverge from the <em class="e000I2">peristome</em>, or soft part around the
mouth, in the center of the lower surface, and converge in
the small area at the top or aboral side. In the center of this
small circular dorsal space is the excretory opening, and surrounding
it are ten plates, five of which have openings into the
egg-sacs. One of them is larger than the others, and is modified
to form the <em class="e000I2">madreporic plate</em>. The other five plates have eye-specks.
The ambulacral zones terminate at these ocular plates.</p>

<p>The numerous spines which cover the animal are of three <a id="pg219"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg219]</span>
kinds, and proceed from the knobs on the exoskeleton, over
which they fit, forming ball-and-socket joints, which enable them
to move in any direction. The long spines are ribbed, and seem
to have no other function than that of protection. The second
set, the <em class="e000I2">pedicellariæ</em>, are very peculiar small organs scattered over
the surface in great numbers, and consisting of a head bearing
three bill-like blades mounted on a long, flexible stalk. The office
of some of the pedicellariæ is to remove waste from the excretory
opening; this is passed down regular lines and dropped into
the water, thus keeping the body clean. Others are constantly
opening and shutting their forks, reaching in all directions and
grasping and removing anything which may have become entangled
in the spines. They also capture floating bits of seaweed,
which they drag over the body to conceal it. A third set of
projections are the <em class="e000I2">sphæridia</em>, small globular bodies said to be
connected with perception.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 435px;">
 <a id="fig-Test-of-sea-urchin"></a>

 <div class="captionleft">Test of sea-urchin, with the spines
 removed to show the arrangement of the plates, lateral view: <em
 class="e000I2">Amb</em>, ambulacral zone with its perforated
 plates; <em class="e000I2">Ap</em>, apical (aboral) pole; <em
 class="e000I2">Int. amb.</em>, interambulacral zones. (From
 Bronn's "Thierreich.")</div>
</div>

<p>The spines vary greatly in size, number, and form in different
species, and are such conspicuous features as to make the
identification of species easy. In some the spines are solid and
fluted; <a id="pg220"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg220]</span>
in others they are hollow, sharp, and brittle; again in others
they are short and silky, or very long and serrated, and so
on. In one species they are so broad and flat as to resemble
little sails. (See <em class="e000I2">Dorocidaris</em>.) (<a
href="#Plate-LVI">Plate LVI.</a>)</p>

<p>The mouth, over which five long teeth project, is a part of
Aristotle's lantern, which forms a curious and prominent feature
in the center of the lower surface. Ten tentacles, like large
tube-feet without suckers, lie around the mouth. The alimentary
canal, starting in Aristotle's lantern, winds in two and a half
coils around the inside of the shell, supported by mesenteries,
and terminates in the excretory opening on the aboral surface. The
sea-urchin has also a water-vascular system similar to that of
starfishes (<a href="#pg206">page 206</a>). When the tube-feet are
distended they project beyond the spines, and enable the animal to
move slowly about; but sea-urchins are less active than starfishes,
and although they are so well protected by spines and have few
enemies after maturity, they lie in sluggish idleness in secluded
places, and for further concealment often cover themselves with
seaweeds or stones.</p>

<p>The sea-urchin has a nervous system, which starts in a ring
around the mouth, ramifies through the body, and terminates in
the eye-plates. The tube-feet and all the spines are under nervous
as well as muscular control. Egg-sacs lie under the apex of the
shell and open by separate ducts into the five plates on the small
upper disk. Through these the eggs are discharged into the
water, where they become free-swimming larvæ, called <em class="e000I2">Pluteus</em>.
This immature sea-urchin (Pluteus) undergoes several curious
transformations in the course of its development, and does not in
any way resemble the mature animal. In spring the apical disk
of the females will often be found covered with orange-colored
ova, and that of the males with white sperms. In the growth of
the animal, in its mature form, the shell enlarges by accretions
of lime on the individual plates, or ossicles, of the exoskeleton,
and by new plates formed around the apical disk. Sea-urchins
are compared to starfishes folded over, the eye-specks on the ends
of the rays meeting in a small area around the excretory opening,
the ambulacra following spherical lines and leaving the mouth, as
before, on the ventral side. <a id="pg221"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg221]</span></p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Echinoidea</em> present great differences in shape, being more
or less spherical, oval, discoid, and heart-shaped. These variations
are associated with the differences of internal structure,
the openings of the digestive tract being at the opposite poles in
the spherical and oval forms, but excentric in the disk-&#160;and heart-shaped
species. The sea-urchins are grouped in three orders in
accordance with these variations. All are characterized by the
absence of arms, by having the calcareous plates immovably
united to form a firm test, and by the great development of the
movable spines upon the plates.</p>

<p>Sea-urchins are sometimes called <em class="e000I2">sea-eggs</em>, perhaps from their
shape, but possibly from the edible quality of some species, which
are eaten by the natives of the shore, who take them at the
spawning season, when the egg-sacs are distended. They are gregarious,
and frequently are so crowded together as literally to pave
the surface of rocks and the bottoms of tide-pools in sheltered
places. The following is quoted from A. Agassiz: "Many of the
<em class="e000I2">Desmosticha</em> along coasts exposed to the action of the waves live
in cavities which they hollow out of the solid rock. This they
do, not by means of any solvent, but by mere mechanical action.
They chisel out with their teeth the solid rock by incessant turning
round and round, and keep their cave, where they are frequently
prisoners for the rest of their existence, up to the size
required by the growth of their test and spines, by constant
gnawing. On the coast of California the common <em class="e000I2">Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus</em> occurs in this way. We find long tracts of
shore, where this sea-urchin is common, completely honeycombed
and pitted by cavities and depressions in which they seek shelter
against the powerful surf continually beating against the rocks.
The same species does not excavate in sheltered places, where the
sea-urchins can find protection between the interstices of large
fragments of rock or ledges more or less sheltered from the
more direct action of the open sea."</p>

<p>Sea-urchins in cavities of granite rock, where the openings are
too small for the animal to get out, are to be seen in thousands
on the coast of France at Croisic, Lower Loire. Spines of large
sea-urchins are used as slate-pencils by the missionaries in the
Pacific Islands. <a id="pg222"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg222]</span></p>

about two inches in diameter. The spines are moderately slender and
longitudinally striated. It feeds partly on diatoms and other small
algæ, which it cuts from the rocks with its sharp teeth. It also devours
dead fishes, bones and all, and in return is swallowed whole by the wolffish
and other large fishes. It moves by means of the tube-feet on its

<p>The animals of this order, commonly known as sand-cakes or
sand-dollars, are flat and circular like disks. Sometimes they
are cut at intervals on the margin; again they have slits through
the body (<em class="e000I2">lunules</em>). They have a well-marked star-shaped figure
on the dorsal surface. This figure is formed by the ambulacra,
or tube-feet, which run in five rounded or petal-shaped lines on
the under surface. The mouth, in Aristotle's lantern, is in the
center of the somewhat concave ventral surface, the petal-like
ambulacral zones meeting at the central space. The excretory
opening is on the margin of the disk, at a point between two of
the sections of the star-like figure. This marks the posterior part
of the body, while the opposite arm of the star marks the front
or anterior end. The spines are very fine and silky, and are
spread abundantly over the whole animal. Clypeasteroids are
mainly found in sand considerably below low-water mark, though
some species thrive where they are exposed to the surf on open
sandy beaches.</p>

HEART-URCHINS</span></h5>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Spatangoidea</em>, or heart-urchins, have heart-shaped or thick
elliptical bodies. The mouth and excretory opening are both
away from the center and on the ventral side. These animals
seem deformed, so much are they out of symmetry and so different
in outline from the other orders of the class. The ambulacral
zones are in circles, or petaloid in outline, as in cake-urchins,
but are not continuous, and the anterior one is usually
unlike the others and frequently without pores. The entire body
is covered with spines, and these are the chief organs of locomotion;
the greater part of them turn backward, giving the living
animal the semblance of a porcupine. The mouth is protected by
a projecting plate, but Aristotle's lantern is absent in this order.
The anatomy is in general the same as in the other orders, but
the organs are turned in conformity with the inclosing shell.
Most of these animals bury themselves in sand or mud and live in
deep water; a few only are littoral species.</p>

 SEA-CUCUMBERS</span></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The holothurians, or sea-cucumbers, although in appearance
quite unlike starfishes and sea-urchins, have the characteristic
ambulacral zones and other features of the group. In form
they are cylindrical, and, when the tentacles and tube-feet are
retracted, resemble fat worms; when fully expanded they are
somewhat like sea-anemones, the tentacles forming a rosette-like
top. The walls of the body are tough and muscular, with small
calcareous deposits or spicules of various shapes in the skin.
The mouth is at one end, the excretory opening at the other, and
along the body are double rows of tube-feet. Often instead of
tube-feet, or together with them, are conical processes without
suckers. The ambulacra, when arranged in regular zones, are
used for locomotion only in the lines running from the madreporic
plate. In some species three of the zones are near together,
and form a kind of sole on which the animal creeps; again the
tube-feet are wholly suppressed, as in <em class="e000I2">Synapta</em>. Besides progressing
by means of these suckers, the holothurians move, as do
worms, by the extension and contraction of the body. The inner
surface of the tough membrane inclosing the body is lined with
powerful longitudinal and transverse muscles, by means of which
the creature contracts and lengthens its body and changes its
form in a wonderful manner. Around the mouth are tentacles,
which are often much branched and are used as organs of touch
and smell, and sometimes have an ear-sac at the base. From the
mouth the food-canal, making one long coil, extends to a chamber
<a id="pg231"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg231]</span> (<em class="e000I2">cloaca</em>) at the other pole. The cloaca gives off a pair of
much-branched respiratory trees, which are constantly supplied with
water by the contractions of the cloaca. At the base of one of
the respiratory trees are singular structures known as <em class="e000I2">Cuvierian
organs</em>. They are numerous, viscid, glandular tubes, which the
animal can throw out, and which will adhere closely to almost
anything. The holothurian has a water-vascular system, the
madreporic plate being near the mouth, but not opening to the
outside, and a nervous system which starts from a ring which
lies around the mouth. The egg-sacs are branched tubes, often
highly colored, which open to the outside, close to the wreath
of tentacles surrounding the mouth.</p>

<p>The larvæ, when free-swimming, are called <em class="e000I2">Auricula</em>. In the
deep-water species, <em class="e000I2">Cucumaria crocea</em> and <em class="e000I2">Psolus ephippiger</em>, the
eggs, when discharged, and the young are carried on the back of
the mother. In <em class="e000I2">Cucumaria lævigata</em> there is a brood-pouch, while
in <em class="e000I2">Synapta viviparia</em> the young develop in the body-cavity.</p>

<p>The holothurians have the singular power of ejecting the
whole of their internal organs and of growing them again in case
they escape the enemy they have endeavored to elude by this
strange method. They also turn themselves inside out, as it
were, as if from <em class="e000I2">nausea</em>, when confined in water too stale for their
uses. Often the viscera are ejected through holes in the sides of
the body broken by violent muscular contractions.</p>

<p>Holothurians are generally distributed through all seas, but are
congregated in greatest numbers in Eastern seas. Their habitat
extends from shallow to very deep water. They are found in
tide-pools, on rocks, and in sand or mud. Like worms, they live
on organic particles contained in mud and sand, which they take
into the gullet and pass through the alimentary canal.</p>

is covered with rounded overlapping scales

inches long and about one inch thick.
<a id="pg233"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg233]</span> Rows of tube-feet lie near together, on a flat under surface, and form a
kind of sole on which the animal creeps. The oral end of the body is a
little raised and bears ten tentacles; these tentacles are profusely and
finely branched, and when expanded are about as long as the body.
The aboral end is obtuse and a little raised. Around the oral and anal
openings the scales are grouped, forming circles in those regions. This
holothurian is bright red in color, and when expanded is a beautiful
object, perhaps the most attractive in appearance of any in the class.
When retracted it has the aspect of an ascidian, and for a time was
supposed to belong to that group. It is found on the New England coast
on the under side of large shelving rocks.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Synapta</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. tenuis.</em> This curious animal is long and slender, and so transparent
that its internal organs are clearly visible. Around the mouth are a
circular tube and a wreath of twelve branching tentacles. There are no
ambulacra. Little spots scattered irregularly over the surface show,
when highly magnified, small warts, each one of which has a calcareous
projection shaped like a little anchor. By means of these anchors and
by the contractions of its body the animal moves through the mud or
sand in which it lives, near low-water mark. The sand is collected into
rings at the oral end and pushed downward until the whole animal is
inclosed in a sand-tube. When empty <em class="e000I2">Synapta</em> is white and transparent,
and the digestive canal may be seen wound in a spiral throughout its
length; but when gorged with food, sand, pebbles, and shells can be
distinctly seen filling the food-canal, and the body then has a dark-gray
color. <em class="e000I2">Synapta</em> grows to a length of eighteen inches or more, but
is constantly breaking pieces off its posterior end by muscular contractions.
When kept in confinement it soon commences to constrict its
body at various points, and after a few hours there is nothing left but a
mass of fragments. It is viviparous, that is, it carries its young in the
body-cavity; the eggs are hatched, and the young approach maturity
before they are expelled. This species ranges from Cape Cod to North
Carolina, and can be found in the upper part of its burrows when the
tide is out.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. roseola.</em> This species occurs in the same localities as <em class="e000I2">S. tenuis</em>, and
differs from it mainly in color, which is pale red, due to minute red spots
scattered through the skin.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. rotifera.</em> A species found in Florida. It is light purplish in color,
and has eight or ten branches on each of the twelve tentacles. In this
species the spicules of lime in the skin are shaped like wheels instead of
anchors.</p></div>

<p>The crinoids are inhabitants of deep water, where they grow
in great numbers, forming beds of sea-lilies. Their general
form, which suggests the lily, and their feather-like manner of
branching, give them the two common names of sea-lilies and
sea-feathers. They have a long, jointed stalk, one end of which
is attached, while the other bears the disk of the animal. From
the disk emanate five arms, which divide near the base, making <a id="pg235"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg235]</span>
ten arms in all. The arms have short branches along the sides.
Ambulacral grooves follow the center of all the arms and
branches. The mouth is in the
center of the upper side, which
in this case is the ventral surface.
The genus <em class="eB00I2">Pentacrinus</em> remains
permanently attached, but <em class="eB00I2">Comatula</em>,
at a certain stage of development,
separates from the
stalk and swims freely about by
means of its arms. It can attach
itself temporarily by tubular processes,
which are developed on the
dorsal surface at the point where
the stem was attached. The ossicles,
or plates which cover the
dorsal surface, are free, making
the crinoid an animal of innumerable
joints.</p>

<p>The crinoids are particularly
interesting from the fact that they
have existed from early geologic
times, and their history is written
in stone. In the early ages they
were the only class of echinoderms,
and their evolution into
other forms can be traced through
successive geologic periods. They
existed in such vast numbers that
the fossil forms are plentiful and
are familiar to every student of
geology, and are known as stone-lilies
and encrinites. To-day they
are decadent, there now remaining
only twelve of the two hundred genera which existed formerly. A fine
bed of crinoids is found off Cuba, on the slope of the coast where the
water rapidly deepens from one hundred to two hundred fathoms. <a id="pg236"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg236]</span></p>

<p>Although the crinoids are deep-water forms, and are never
found on the beach, they are given here because they follow in
the system of classification and illustrate another curious class of
echinoderms. The brief description given may add interest to the
fossil forms to be seen in museums.</p>

<h4 title="Arthropoda"><a id="pg244"></a>ARTHROPODA</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>This subdivision of the animal kingdom includes insects, centipedes,
spiders, and crustaceans, which together constitute
more than half the known species of animals. Although these
animals are so unlike in general appearance, it is easy to recognize
the common characteristics which place them together in
one group. The name <em class="e000I2">Arthropoda</em>, meaning "jointed-footed,"
suggests perhaps one of the most obvious points of resemblance.
The <em class="e000I2">Arthropoda</em> have bilateral symmetry, one side of
the body being like the other; they are covered with a horn-like
material (chitin); they are divided into segments; the segments
have appendages; and the appendages are jointed so as to admit
freedom of motion. Their manner of growth is peculiar; they
cast off their rigid external coverings and secrete larger coats of
mail, and at these periods increase in size or undergo metamorphosis.</p>

<p>There are such modifications of these general features as the
habits of the different species demand. For instance, the appendages
may be constructed for walking, swimming, boring, sucking,
or the seizure and preparation of food. In some animals the
appendages form a part of the breathing-organs, in others are
used as organs of sense. Every detail of the organism, down to
the hairs, has its special use and function.</p>

<h5>CLASS <em class="eBU001">CRUSTACEA</em></h5>

<p>The crustaceans vary in size from microscopic minuteness to
two feet or more in length. The giant crab of Japan (<em class="e000I2">Kaempferia
kaempferi</em>) exceeds this, being commonly from eight to twelve feet <a id="pg245"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg245]</span>
across the arms, and is said to reach even greater proportions.
Crustaceans live on land and sea, and in both fresh and salt water;
they may be parasitic, sedentary, or free and active. There are
said to be over ten thousand species, which include crabs, lobsters,
shrimps, beach-fleas, wood-lice, barnacles, and water-fleas. Nine
tenths of the species are marine; of these some are pelagic,
and their transparent forms constitute a part of the plankton.
Others live on the bottom in deep water and attain a large size.
A vast number live in the littoral zone and form a considerable
part of that crowded community. They are scavengers and freebooters,
being great fighters, as well as predatory in their habits.
As a rule, they feed on dead organic matter, which they consume
in surprising quantities; some have also a vegetarian diet. They
have, like starfishes, the singular power of throwing off their
limbs and growing new ones.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em> derive their name from the nature of their crust
or covering. This is earthy and brittle, not stony, like the shells
of mollusks. This crust, or exoskeleton, has various degrees of
firmness, from that of a delicate polished cuticle, seen in small
forms, to the heavy armor of some crabs and the shell-like character
of the covering of barnacles.</p>

<p>The lobster and crab are perhaps the most comprehensive
examples as well as the largest in size of the class, the vast
majority of the species being minute forms. The ocean swarms
with varieties too small to be noticeable to the naked eye.</p>

<p>It is the province of <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em> to consume decaying organic
matter, both animal and vegetable, and in doing this they perform
a great service in purifying the waters of the pool, the shore,
and even the sea. Not only in this are they serviceable, but to a
great extent they serve as food for other animals, their flesh being
palatable and preferred to that of other animals whose diet would
seem to make them more wholesome. The small forms exist in
such myriads, and increase so rapidly, that, although extremely
small, they furnish an inexhaustible supply of food. Even some
whales subsist upon these minute animals, and for man the larger
species are articles of diet that are counted among the luxuries.
The crustaceans are remarkable for their varied forms and for their <a id="pg246"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg246]</span>
perfect adaptation to many different conditions of life. There is
no class in the animal kingdom which presents so wide a range
of organization, or whose structure deviates so widely from the
type form. These differences lie chiefly in the external characters
and in the structure of the appendages.</p>

<p>Some species are solitary, like lobsters and crabs; others, like
shrimps, are gregarious and live in immense shoals. In the
habits of these animals there is much which excites wonder and
interest.</p>

<h4 title="Anatomy Of The Higher Crustacea">ANATOMY OF THE HIGHER CRUSTACEA</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The body of a crustacean is divided into segments, which are
sometimes distinctly separated, like joints, and sometimes fused
into one piece. The head part is called the <em class="e000I2">cephalic</em> portion, the
middle section is the <em class="e000I2">thorax</em>, and the posterior part is the <em class="e000I2">abdomen</em>.
The horn-like covering of the thorax is the <em class="e000I2">carapace</em>; where it
projects over the head it is the <em class="e000I2">rostrum</em>. When the head and
thorax are united, as in most <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>, the anterior or front portion
of the animal is called the <em class="e000I2">cephalothorax</em>. Each segment has
a pair of appendages. Each appendage has a joint attached to
the body; from this arise two jointed branches, the <em class="e000I2">endopodite</em>
and the <em class="e000I2">exopodite</em>, the inner and the outer foot. The appendages
are modified to perform special functions. In front of the mouth
are two pairs: the smaller ones are the <em class="e000I2">antennules</em> and have ears
at the base; the larger ones are <em class="e000I2">antennæ</em> and are feelers. At the
base of the antennæ are the <em class="e000I2">green glands</em>, said to have renal functions.
Both the antennules and the antennæ are fringed with
hairs, which aid in the sense of touch and perhaps of smell. On
each side of the mouth are the <em class="e000I2">mandibles</em>. Then come the <em class="e000I2">maxillæ</em>
and the <em class="e000I2">maxillipeds</em>, used in capturing and tearing the food
and conveying it to the mouth. Thus it will be seen that some of
the appendages around the head are connected with the senses, and
others are used in eating. Those of the thorax are for walking;
those of the abdomen for swimming, guarding the eggs, etc. The
food taken into the mouth passes into the stomach through a
short passage. The stomach is divided into two parts. The front <a id="pg247"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg247]</span>
one contains three long teeth which meet laterally and grind the
food; this is known as the <em class="e000I2">gastric mill</em>.</p>

<p>When sufficiently fine, the food passes through a strainer of
stiff bristles into the smaller portion of the stomach, where it is
partially digested, and from there enters a long, straight intestine
which reaches the length of the body and opens to the outside
on the under side of the <em class="e000I2">telson</em>, or last segment. A large
liver also pours its secretions into the intestine. The green substance
commonly called "fat" in lobsters is the liver.</p>

<p>The heart consists of an elongated tube, or a short sac, which
lies directly under the integument of the back. From this heart-sac,
blood, which is colorless, is sent by arteries to all parts of the
body; it then collects in spaces called <em class="e000I2">venous sinuses</em>, from which
it goes to the gills, and thence back to the heart.</p>

<p>The nervous system begins in a large ganglion in front of the
mouth, called the brain; from this two branches arise, which pass on
each side of the digestive organs, meeting in ganglia in each segment
and extending the whole length of the body. The gills, by
which the animal breathes, are upon the limbs, or on the walls of
the body immediately adjacent to them, and are generally inclosed
in special chambers. In lobsters and crabs two such chambers
are found under the flaps of the carapace, above the walking-legs.
Gills are divided so as to present much surface to the water, from
which they absorb oxygen. They are like a dense mass of little
tubes arranged along a central tube. The class has two kinds of
eyes, simple and compound; the latter are composed of a number of
eyes. In some species the eyes are placed on the ends of movable
stalks, which enable the creature to see in all directions and
from a higher plane than the body occupies. As a rule, the eyes
occur in the head region, but in the shrimp <em class="e000I2">Euphausia</em> they are on
the thorax and abdomen. In barnacles simple eyes exist in the
young stage, but in adult forms there are no apparent visual organs.
The ear (so called) consists of a sac containing small silicious
particles suspended in fluid. Numerous fine hairs on the inner
surface of the sac connect with nerve-fibrils.</p>

<p>The organs of hearing are in various places. In decapods, or
the larger <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>, they are at the base of the antennules. <a id="pg248"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg248]</span></p>

<p>The muscles are white bundles of fibers, and are in strips,
which is an indication of power and activity. There are four
important sets: twisted ventral muscles which bend the tail and
are particularly large and strong, those which straighten the tail,
those moving the appendages, and
those which work the gastric mill.</p>

</div>

<p>The eggs, after being discharged,
are attached to the abdominal legs of
the mother by a kind of cement, or
they are carried in pouches attached
to the thorax. In these positions they
mature, and hatch at different stages
of development in different species.
Some emerge with three pairs of legs,
and are known as <em class="e000I2">Nauplius</em>; some are
<em class="e000I2">Zoëa</em>, having a carapace and abdominal
segments, but no abdominal appendages. Another stage is <em class="e000I2">Megalops</em>,
with large stalked eyes. Others are hatched as miniature adults.
These names were given when the embryo stage was not recognized
and the larvæ were thought to be distinct species.</p>

 <div class="captionleft">Megalops stage of <em class="e000I2">Cancer
 irroratus</em>, just after change from zoëa stage.</div>
</div>

<p>The growth of the animal is effected by moulting. The <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>
are named from the crust-like covering
which envelops them. It is a horny material,
called chitin, in which are deposited particles
of carbonate of lime, making a rigid envelop
which would prevent all freedom of motion,
were it not that there are spaces free from
lime, and thus flexible joints are left. When
the animal expands it throws off this hard
covering and secretes a new and larger one.
As the time of moulting approaches, the old
covering becomes loosened, and a delicate
new one is formed beneath it. The old shell
splits open across the back just behind the
carapace, and the soft animal withdraws first its cephalothorax
and then its abdomen, leaving the cover complete, including even
the covering of the eyes and the lining of the stomach. The <a id="pg249"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg249]</span>
new shell is rapidly hardened, being already formed when the old
one is cast, and the animal regains its normal condition in about
a week; in the meantime it is defenseless, and lies quiet in some
secluded place. Moulting is an exhausting process, and is attended
with great dangers. A great mortality occurs at this time from accidents,
from weakness, and also from helplessness in case of attack.</p>

<p>The hair-like processes scattered over the shell, often like
fringes, are said to be organs of feeling.</p>

<h6>SUBCLASS <em class="eBU001">ENTOMOSTRACA</em></h6>

<p>These are <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em> of small, often microscopic size, of comparatively
simple organization, and with appendages adapted
to serve the purpose of respiration. These minute animals
may be obtained by skimming the surface of the water with
a muslin net, preferably at night, then washing off the inside of
the net with a small quantity of water into a glass dish. Place the
dish on a dark surface before a light, and the little creatures will
gather toward the light, and may be satisfactorily observed with
a glass.</p>

<p class="genushead">ORDER <em class="eBU001">COPEPODA</em></p>

<p>This order, though composed of minute forms, is one of great
economic importance, from the fact that the little crustaceans exist
in vast numbers and furnish a very considerable part of the food
of many fishes. <em class="eB00I2">Cyclops</em> is the most common of the fresh-water,
and <em class="eB00I2">Cetochilus</em> of the marine genera. These, together with
other genera, swarm in water wherever life exists, from the smallest
pools and ditches to the broad surface of the ocean. Without having
drawn a surface-net on some sheltered bay, it is difficult to have
an idea of the myriads of <em class="e000I2">Entomostraca</em> in the sea. Although
nearly transparent and of such delicate texture as to be almost
jelly-like, they sometimes color the sea with a reddish tint for
miles. Whales which have baleen, or fringes of whalebone,
in the mouth subsist on these small organisms, which are
called "brit" by the whalemen. The whales, sometimes in schools,
rush through the water with open mouths, engulfing these little <a id="pg250"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg250]</span>
crustaceans, the baleen straining them from the water. Although
devoured in such immense quantities, and sometimes lying dead in
sheets of scum on the surface of the water, they maintain their
numbers by the exceeding rapidity with which they reproduce.
It has been computed that the descendants of one <em class="e000I2">Cyclops</em> may
number in one year 4,500,000,000, provided all the young reach
maturity and produce a full number of offspring.</p>

<p>One of the free marine forms, <em class="eB00I2">Sapphirina</em>, is of especial interest,
as it surpasses all animals in phosphorescence and sparkles
by day as well as by night. It is one quarter of an inch long,
and is broad and flat.</p>

<p>Besides the myriads of free-swimming copepods, there are parasitic
forms in great number. The marine parasitic forms are
commonly known as fish-lice. They have various habits, some
living as commensals, others attaching themselves to animals
only to be carried about; the true parasites live upon the blood
and tissues of their hosts, and may fasten themselves to the external
parts of the body or to the internal organs. Whales, fishes
of all kinds, mollusks, starfishes, jellyfishes, and corals, all have
some form of parasite, and many have several different kinds of
guests. It is said that the haddock has more than a dozen which
infest its external and internal membranes.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">Nicothoë</em> is found on the gills of lobsters. The truly parasitic
forms are usually very degenerate and lose the characteristics of
their order.</p>

<p>Barnacles of the genus <em class="e000I2">Balanus</em> (acorn-shells)
(<a href="#Plate-LIX">Plate LIX.</a>)
are familiar objects on rocky shores, which they often whiten with
their shells, and those of the genus <em class="e000I2">Lepas</em> are also widely known.
The name of the order is descriptive of their curled appendages.
The appendages are fringed like feathers and are drawn into or
protruded from the shell at will. When extended they are constantly
in motion, and create currents which carry food to the <a id="pg251"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg251]</span>
mouth of the animal, which is dependent upon such food as comes
within range of its tentacles.</p>

</div>

<p>Their life-history is interesting. The young barnacle, called a
<em class="e000I2">nauplius</em>, in no way resembles the adult. When it emerges from
the egg it is a free and independent animal, with one eye, three
pairs of legs, and a single shell. It
swims about for a while and moults
several times. It then has two eyes, two
shells, and six pairs of legs. At this
period it seeks a permanent home, and
attaches its anterior end to the object it
selects by means of its antennæ, which
have become suckers. It makes its hold
secure by secreting a cement which
permanently fastens it to the spot. It
then undergoes metamorphosis, loses its bivalve shell and its
eyes, and attains its characteristic <em class="e000I2">cirripeds</em>, or curled feathery
legs, and a new shell covering. During these transformations,
from the time it becomes
fixed until it attains
its adult form,
the barnacle fasts, living
by the absorption
of its own animal fat.
Its food subsequently
consists of the minute
animal forms which
abound in the sea. Its
further growth is by
moulting, but parts
only of its covering
are disengaged; the
shell is permanent, and
its successive stages
of growth are marked
upon it by lines, as in mollusks. The lining of the shell, or enveloping
skin of the animal, and also the cuticle of the legs are <a id="pg252"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg252]</span>
shed, and in the spring of the year these thin, glossy casts are found
in abundance floating on the surface of the water near the shore.</p>

<p>There are but three orders of barnacles, namely, those in which
the shell is directly attached to the rocks, those which are attached
to floating objects by a long stalk, and those which are parasitic
on animals. A species of the third order infests the whale.</p>

<p>The older zoölogists classed barnacles with the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>, but in
1829 Vaughan Thompson, in the study of their embryology,
found that they should be classed with crustaceans, in company
with crabs, shrimps, and water-fleas, with which their immature
forms show direct relationship.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Lepas</em></p>

<p>This genus is commonly known as the ship-barnacle, also as
the goose-barnacle. It attaches itself to floating logs as well as
to ships, but the latter form its principal home; consequently it
is a great voyager, and, though common everywhere, is everywhere
considered a stranger. The same species are found on
ships coming from the most remote and widely separated regions,
and so they cannot be considered native to any one locality.
They are wanderers on the deep, and grow in such numbers on
the bottoms of ships, especially of those which sail in warm seas,
that they seriously impede the progress of the vessels. Aside
from diminishing its speed, they do a ship no injury.</p>

<p>There was a tradition, which lasted several centuries, that geese
were hatched from these shells, which somewhat resemble eggs.
Gerard, in the appendix to his "Herball or Generale Historie of
Plants" (1597), gives a picture of shells of <em class="e000I2">Lepas</em> growing on a
tree, with geese falling from them and swimming about in the
water below. His description is as follows: "There are founde
in the North parts of Scotland and the islands adjacent called
Orchades certaine trees whereon do growe certaine shell fishes of a
white color, tending to russet, wherein are conteined little living
creatures; which shells in time of maturitie do open, and out of
them grow those little living foules whom we call barnakles, in the
North of England brant geise, and in Lancashire tree geise; but <a id="pg253"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg253]</span>
the other that do fall upon the land do perish and come to nothing."
He then describes in detail the various transformations,
and ends with: "But what our eies have seen and hands have
touched we shall declare."</p>

<p>The long, flexible stalk of <em class="e000I2">Lepas</em> is its anterior end. Generally
this stalk is only half an inch long, but in some species it attains
the length of a foot.</p>

<p>Huxley describes the barnacle as a crustacean fixed by its head
and kicking food into its mouth with its legs. The mouth has a
pair of small mandibles and two pairs of maxillæ, the last pair
uniting to form a lower lip. The thorax has six pairs of branched
appendages. The body is enveloped in a fold of skin, to which
are attached five shell-like plates. One of these plates is long
and narrow, and extends along the dorsal side; two are large and
triangular (the terga); two are small and triangular (the scuta),
the long point extending downward. These shells are on the
free or posterior end.</p>

<p>Barnacles have a nervous system, consisting of a brain and a
chain of five or more ganglia, but no special respiratory or circulatory
organs are known; the cirripeds, or feet, are supposed to
perform these functions. They have also a food-canal, a digestive
gland, and excretory tubes. The eggs are carried under the
external fold of the skin in flat cakes.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. anatifera.</em> The shell is bluish-white, showing lines of growth
and faint radiating lines emanating from the anterior basal angle. The
upper valves are narrow; the long tips point downward, and the top is
blunted, leaving a space which is occupied only by a membrane. Near
the apex of the shell, at the back, is a distinct angle. The dorsal valve
is broad, not much compressed, and is sometimes grooved lengthwise.
The cartilage of the shell and the stalk adjoining the shell are orange-colored.
The stalk is grayish-brown and the cirri flesh-colored.
The stalk is from one inch to six inches long. The shell is one inch
long.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. striata.</em> Shells bluish-white; valves sharply triangular; dorsal

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Balanus</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Balanus</em> is known as the "acorn-shell," or "sea-acorn," and is
found in vast numbers and of all sizes between tide-marks,
incrusting rocks and the piles of piers. It also may be found
attached to floating objects or to shells, or even to living animals,
but its usual habitat is stationary. Unlike <em class="e000I2">Lepas</em>, it has no stalk,
the shell being directly attached to some object. The body is
surrounded by a fold of skin, to which are attached a shell consisting
of six or more plates and a fourfold lid, or <em class="e000I2">operculum</em>,
consisting of two <em class="e000I2">scuta</em> and two <em class="e000I2">terga</em>. The operculum may be
called the door, as the animal opens and shuts it at will and
has complete protection when it is closed. If one taps a rock
<a id="pg255"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg255]</span> incrusted with barnacles, and holds the ear near, the closing of
the many doors may be distinctly heard.</p>

<p>The development of <em class="e000I2">Balanus</em> from the larval stage, as also
the anatomy of the adult, is similar to that of <em class="e000I2">Lepas</em>. When
covered with water and unmolested, there may be seen over a bed
of barnacles thousands of tiny fringed feet waving to and fro.
The motions look like gestures; they are perfectly regular and
rapid, numbering eighty to a hundred a minute. The shell
covering formed by barnacles on piles of wharves and bridges is
said to be a protective agent; otherwise the barnacles seem to
have no economic value in nature, as, unlike other animals, they
do not serve, except in very small measure, as food to other
classes. The tautog and perhaps some other fishes feed partly
upon them. They are sometimes an obstacle to oyster-culture, as
they fasten upon the objects intended for oyster embryos, and,
growing faster than the latter, soon crowd them off. One species,
<em class="e000I2">Coronula diadema</em>, fastens to the skin of whales. It attains the
size of two inches in diameter. The shell is half an inch thick
and full of cavities, into which the skin of the whale is drawn,
giving the barnacle a secure hold. (<a href="#Plate-LIX">Plate LIX.</a>)</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. balanoides</em> (Stimp.), <em class="eB00I2">B. ovularis</em> (Gould), the rock-barnacle.
This is perhaps the most conspicuous of the barnacles. It inhabits the
whole northern Atlantic coast, and is so abundant that it not only
whitens the rocks with a complete incrustation of shells, but the
animals are so crowded that many of them lose their normal shapes and
become greatly elongated. When the rocks are covered with water
they seem alive, on account of the thousands of waving tentacles. This
species also incrusts woodwork between tide-marks.</p>

<p>The shell is small, white, and variable in shape; sometimes its height
is less than the diameter of its base; again the height is several times
greater and the summit broader than the base. In its early stages the
valves are smooth, but later the base is scalloped by four or five grooves.
The summit of the plates is even and blunt. The aperture is diamond-shaped.
Two valves of the operculum are pointed at the tips; two
are blunt, making a deep notch in the summit. These valves are the
distinctive feature by which to recognize this species, which varies so
much in outward form; the species is also distinguished by its membranous
base, which does not form a solid plate like that of other
species.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. eburneus</em>, the ivory barnacle. This species, like <em class="e000I2">B. balanoides</em>, is a
very common barnacle, and is found on all kinds of submerged woodwork,
whether fixed or floating. It is also found on the carapace of
<a id="pg256"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg256]</span> crabs and <em class="e000I2">Limulus</em>, and on mollusks. It is chiefly found on objects below
low-water mark. It ranges from Massachusetts Bay to Florida. It is
easily distinguished from the preceding by its low, broad form and
shelly base. The shell is smooth and circular at the base, and inclines
backward, forming an oblique cone with a triangular opening; the plates
terminate in points at the summit and incline backward, the last one
forming a kind of beak. The operculum is pyramidal; two of its valves
have both transverse and longitudinal lines well defined at the base, and
are coarsely toothed at the edges; the posterior valves are slightly
grooved across.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. rugosus</em> (Gould), <em class="eB00I2">B. crenatus</em>. Shell white, cylindrical, somewhat
conical, rugged, the summit usually as broad as the base; height
often greater than diameter; aperture diamond-shaped, plates ending at
the summit in acute spreading points, the posterior plate folded and
curved like a beak; plates rough, with coarse, irregular ribs; valves of
the operculum at the summit acute, with diverging points; the points
striated. Found on shells and stones in deep water and also on bottoms
of ships.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. geniculatus.</em> Shell dirty greenish-white, cone-shaped; aperture
about the size of base; shell-plates triangular, unequal in breadth, and
with alternate large and small ribs; the smaller ribs compressed and
roughened on the edges by the conspicuous lines of growth which run
across them; depressed areas between the plates marked with fine cross-lines;
front valves of the operculum have coarse plated ridges, which
incline over one another and are crossed by fine radiating lines; diameter
at base one to one and a half inches; height two thirds the diameter.
Found on pecten shells, and abundant off the coast of Maine.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. tintinnabulum.</em> Shell pink to purplish, conical, with six triangular
plates, which are grooved, forming unequal ribs, and crossed by distinct
lines of growth; spaces between plates crossed by lateral lines; posterior
valves of the operculum longer than the others and curved forward,
resembling the beak of a bird of prey; diameter at the base one inch;
height one and a half inches. Found in warm waters and on vessels
from the South.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em> <em class="eBU003">RHIZOCEPHALA</em></p>

<p>These are parasitic forms and very degenerate. <em class="eB00I2">Sacculina</em> lives
on crabs, and its term of life is about three years, during which
period the afflicted crab does not moult. Its shape is that of an
ovoid sac on a stalk, which it attaches between two segments of
the ventral surface of its host. The stalk divides and ramifies in
a root-like manner within the body of the crab, from whose vital
elements it absorbs its nourishment. The roots spread like a
mycelium through the whole crab, even to the claws.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">Peltogaster</em> lives on hermit-crabs. <a id="pg257"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg257]</span></p>

<h6>CLASS <em class="eBU001">MALACOSTRACA</em></h6>

<p>This subclass comprises highly organized <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>, usually of
considerable size, having the appendages much differentiated, the
thorax with eight segments, and the abdomen with seven segments.</p>

<p class="genushead">ORDER <em class="eBU001">SCHIZOPODA</em></p>

<p>The name, meaning "cleft-footed," applies to the appendages
of the thorax, which are once-branched (<em class="e000I2">biramous</em>). Gills, when
present, are attached to these feet, and hang freely in the water.
A delicate carapace covers the thorax; the abdomen is proportionately
very large, often twice the length of the cephalothorax.
In <em class="e000I2">Mysis</em> the eggs are carried in pouches under the thorax, giving
the common name of "opossum-shrimp" to this small, transparent,
phosphorescent crustacean.</p>

straight and are armed with spines; the extremity is cleft; eyes large
and prominent. Found abundantly in winter on the shores of still,
muddy bays and sounds, especially among eel-grass.</p></div>

<p class="genushead">ORDER <em class="eBU001">DECAPODA</em>
<span class="smaller">("<em class="e000I2">Ten-footed</em>")</span></p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Decapoda</em> are named from their ten walking-legs. The
higher forms of crustaceans belong to this order. All the <em class="e000I2">Decapoda</em>
have a similar anatomy, but are placed in two subdivisions <a id="pg258"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg258]</span>
according to their external form. In <em class="e000I2">Macrura</em>, the first subdivision,
belong the lobsters, crawfish, shrimps, prawns, and hermit-crabs,
animals having a long and more or less cylindrical body,
with the abdomen extended; in <em class="e000I2">Brachyura</em>, the second subdivision,
are placed the crabs, animals having the thorax broad and flat,
and the abdomen bent under the thorax. The <em class="e000I2">Decapoda</em> have
twenty segments, all of which, except the last one, have, at
some period of life, a pair of appendages. The first two pairs of
appendages, or, in the stalk-eyed forms, the first three pairs, are
especially connected with the senses, and are often fringed
with hairs, which are also considered to have a sense-function.
The <em class="e000I2">antennules</em>, or first pair of appendages after the eye-stalks,
are sometimes divided into two or three branches. At the base
of the antennules are the ears. The <em class="e000I2">antennæ</em>, or second pair of
appendages, are undivided, but are larger than the first pair, and
are often very long. At the base of the antennæ are the renal
glands. Both the antennules and the antennæ are slender, elongated,
movable, and full of joints. In some species they are greatly
modified, as in <em class="e000I2">Scyllarus</em>, where they are developed into broad
swimming-plates and, perhaps, as shovels for burrowing; in some
amphipods they are used as swimming-organs. (<a href="#Plate-LX">Plate LX.</a>)</p>

<p>The next six pairs of appendages are grouped about the mouth.
They are the <em class="e000I2">mandibles</em>, the <em class="e000I2">maxillæ</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">maxillipeds</em>. The
mandibles are at the mouth-opening, and, being heavy and hard,
are adapted to tearing and grinding; they have a jointed attachment,
the <em class="e000I2">palpus</em>, whose office is to keep the mandibles clean.
The two pairs of maxillæ are delicate and leaf-like. The three
pairs of maxillipeds grow gradually larger, the last pair being
very prominent and extending over the other mouth-parts. Next
come five pairs of walking-feet. One or more pairs of these feet
have pincer-like ends, or claws. Some species have the claws immensely
developed, as in lobsters. The claws are the <em class="e000I2">chelæ</em>, and
the feet which bear the <em class="e000I2">chelæ</em> are termed the <em class="e000I2">chelipeds</em>. The rest
of the walking-feet have generally single, hook-like ends, but are
variously modified in different species. The abdominal segments
have six pairs of appendages, also variously modified. The last
segment is without appendages, but often is extended into a tail, <a id="pg259"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg259]</span>
or fin-like expansion. The next to the last segment, in many forms,
has appendages modified into swimming-plates, which extend on
each side of the telson, forming a broad, fan-like caudal extremity.</p>

<p>They have, then, to correspond to the twenty segments of the
body, two pairs of sensory, six pairs of mouth-, and five pairs of
walking-appendages attached to the cephalothorax, and six pairs
on the abdomen. The terminal segment, or telson, is without appendages.
The exopodite is present on the maxillipeds, but disappears
from the walking-feet in the higher forms.</p>

<p>In moulting the <em class="e000I2">Macrura</em> split in the longitudinal line down the
back; in the <em class="e000I2">Brachyura</em> the split occurs across the body at the
point between the thorax and the abdomen.</p>

SHRIMPS, PRAWNS, LOBSTERS, CRAWFISH, AND HERMIT-CRABS</span></p>

<p>The characteristic features of the <em class="e000I2">Macrura</em> are an elongated body
with the abdomen usually extended; a carapace, somewhat cylindrical;
and the last pair of appendages of the abdomen (which
are attached to the next to last segment) united with the last
segment, or telson, to form a powerful caudal fin, used for swimming
backward. The creeping forms in moving walk forward,
but swim backward.</p>

<p class="genushead">FREE-SWIMMING FORMS: SHRIMPS AND PRAWNS</p>

<p>In these animals the body is compressed and the carapace is
not hard. The abdomen is very large in proportion to the
cephalothorax, and has a peculiar bend. The rostrum is often
longer than the thorax. The eye-stalks, antennæ, and legs sometimes
attain extraordinary length, and the chelæ (claws) are not
always on the first pair of legs. In some species chelæ are on
two or three pairs of the legs. Above the antennæ are expanded
antennal scales, which, together with the long bases of the
antennules and very prominent eye-stalks, make the head a broad
and conspicuous feature. The difference between shrimps and
prawns is not very well defined, the small individuals seeming to
be generally called shrimps, the larger full-grown ones prawns. <a id="pg260"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg260]</span>
Prawns are known as <em class="e000I2">crevettes</em> in France and as <em class="e000I2">Garnelen</em> in
Germany, where they are largely used as food. In the United
States the shrimp-fishery is an industry of the South. On the

A ridge or crest extends along the center of the carapace, and
terminates in a long, pointed, toothed rostrum, the teeth being fringed
with hair on the inner side. The antennæ are a foot or more in length;
there are chelæ on the first three pairs of thoracic feet; the swimming-feet
and lateral margins of the segments of the abdomen are fringed
with hair; and the caudal appendages are longer than the telson. It

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. vulgaris</em>, the common sand-shrimp. It ranges from Labrador to
North Carolina on the Atlantic coast and from Alaska to southern California
on the Pacific coast. It is found in abundance on sandy shores at
low-water mark, and in shallow water below tide-mark; also among
rocks and seaweeds. When left by the tide it buries itself in the sand.
Its color varies with its location, rendering it inconspicuous. Upon the
<a id="pg261"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg261]</span> sandy shores it is translucent, pale in color, and often specked, closely
resembling the sand, while on dark, muddy bottoms it is much darker.
This is an edible shrimp, eagerly devoured by fishes; it is also gathered
for the markets. The body of <em class="e000I2">C. vulgaris</em>
is broad at the anterior end and
tapers to a sharp point at the posterior
extremity. A pair of broad, divided
appendages on the cylindrical segment,
which is next to the last on the abdomen,
together with the sharp telson, form
a fan-like swimming-tail. As in all
shrimps, the antennæ are long and have
plate-like antennal scales at the base,
which are fringed with hairs. The mandibles
are long. The movable finger of
the chela is folded across the extremity
of the claw.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. franciscorum</em>, the California

to the side of the claw instead of across
its extremity. Its color is light or dark
yellowish-gray, mottled. This is the
shrimp extensively gathered by the
Chinese for commercial purposes. The
shrimp-meat is dried and cured, and
then separated by blowers very much
as wheat is cleaned. It is exported to

to New Jersey. The lobster-fishery is one of great importance,
and of such value that it is governed by stringent laws. The <a id="pg262"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg262]</span>
annual catch on the Atlantic coast of North America amounts to
many millions of lobsters, the money value of which is very
large.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. americanus</em>, the common lobster of the Atlantic coast. The
characteristic feature of the lobster is its enormously developed chelæ,
or pincer-claws, which are on the
first pair of walking-feet. Small
claws occur on the next two pairs,
and simple hooks on the remaining
two pairs. The appendages
on the abdomen are divided (biramous).
In the female they are
used, excepting the last pair, for
holding the eggs; in the male
they are greatly abridged. The
appendages on the next to last
segment are divided and broadly
flattened, forming with the telson
a powerful swimming-paddle.
The rostrum is very prominent,
and has a long, pointed end,
slightly upturned, and several
spines.</p>

<p>The lobster belongs to the creeping forms of the order; it walks
forward by means of the ten feet, but swims backward by using its
caudal fin. It lives in deep water on rocky bottoms, hiding among
stones, etc., but frequents sandy shores as well. It lives on
dead and decaying animal matter, and it would seem strange that
its flesh is so palatable, were it not that we know that chemical
combinations which take place in the assimilation of food make one
kind as clean, when transformed, as another. All the crustaceans
have a similar dietary, being scavengers of the sea; yet fishes
find them more acceptable than other animal food, and fishes
capable of capturing larger prey subsist largely on the minute
entomostracans described elsewhere.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p>The lobster is so large that it can easily be
dissected, and will serve as a type of the structure of
<em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>. In dissecting one
can follow the descriptions given of the anatomy of <em

<p>The female lobster carries her eggs on the abdominal legs, to which
they are glued by a kind of cement. After the young emerge from the
egg, the zoëæ still cling to the mother for a little time. The lobster
moults eight times the first year, five times the second, and three times
the third year, after which the male moults twice and the female once a
year. It retires to some secluded spot for this operation, which is attended
with many dangers. The back splits open longitudinally and
the animal slowly withdraws, leaving the shell complete. In preparation
for moulting, the lime around the
contracted joints of the chelæ is
absorbed, so that the soft flesh can
pass through. Any injury to a
limb at the time of moulting, or
which results from fighting or
from any accident, is repaired at
successive moultings, and a lost
member is replaced by a new, but
not always a perfect, one.</p></div>

simple and end in points; the first pair are the longest, and the
following ones gradually diminish in size. The ventral surface is
rough and spiny. The abdomen is of about the same length as the

caught in the fish-traps. They are uncommon. The very peculiar

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. arcuata.</em> This curious little crab, found on the Florida coast,
carries the half of a bivalve shell over its back. Its fifth pair of thoracic

legs and the spiny front edge of the carapace, enable the crab to hold
the shell in position. This crab was formerly classed with the hermits,

name.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">PAGURIDÆ</em><span class="smaller">
THE HERMIT-CRABS</span></p>

<p>In these curious animals the posterior part of the body is not
protected by a crustaceous covering, and therefore the animal seeks
protection by inserting its soft and defenseless abdomen into
some hollow object, usually the shell of a gasteropod mollusk, as
the whelk or the periwinkle (<em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Littorina</em>). The hermit-crabs do not
always use a shell for this purpose, as they are sometimes
found in the tubes of plant-stems or in sponges. Like other
organisms in the animal world, they seem <a id="pg265"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg265]</span> well fitted to make the best of their
surroundings, the body becoming modified to suit the peculiar
conditions under which they live. In those which inhabit shells the
abdomen becomes spiral, in conformity to the convolutions of the
shell. All the abdominal appendages are more or less atrophied; the
sixth pair become like hooks, and these fasten to the columella of
the shell, keeping the crab securely attached to it. In the female
some of the abdominal appendages are hair-like and are adapted
to carrying the eggs. The thorax, being protected, is protruded
from the shell at will. The first pair of feet are much larger
than the others, and are provided with claws (chelæ). The first
right foot is usually much larger than the left, and, besides the
usual functions of capturing and crushing prey, the claw, or hand,
serves as an operculum to close the mouth of the shell when the
crab retires completely within it. The small left hand is shaped
to fill out the parts of the opening not covered by the right
one, thus making a close fit. The next two pairs of feet end in
simple hooks, and are used for walking and dragging the crab along
when he travels. These crabs move about very fast, and the houses
upon their backs seem no encumbrance. <a id="pg266"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg266]</span></p>

 lives.</div>
</div>

<p>In some genera both hands are alike; in others the left one is
the larger. In the case of hermits which live in tooth-shells, the
right hand is cylindrical in form, fitting the circular opening of
the shell. The other extreme is found in the genus <em class="e000I2">Cancellus</em>,
where both the chelipeds and the first pair of ambulatory feet
are ingeniously shaped, so that when closed they form a round
operculum, or door, which closes the way into the compact sponge
which this crab has for its carcinœcium, or house. It is interesting
to note these differences and observe the perfection with
which the feet are formed and jointed to suit the openings of
different shells. Some genera show other adaptations to their
twisted houses, the eye-stalks being uneven in length and the
ambulatory feet unequal on the opposite sides. Besides this,
some species are hairy and cover themselves with dirt for further
protection. The exposed claws of some hermits have a special
armature of spines, which make a fringe of points around the
opening of the shell when the crab is withdrawn.</p>

 the cavity. The polyps are not expanded.</div>
</div>

<p>As the hermit grows he is occasionally obliged to find a new or
larger shell, and there are amusing anecdotes of the troubles he
experiences at these times while house-hunting. Very often he tries
several shells before he finds one to fit. There is a tradition,
not, however, well authenticated, that if the shell chosen happens
to be occupied by its natural owner, the crab tears out and devours
the unfortunate occupant. If the desired shell is occupied by
another hermit inferior in strength to himself, he proceeds to take
possession by violence. He then examines carefully the empty shell,
inserting his legs and feelers, and if he decides to occupy it he
withdraws his abdomen from the old shell and darts it so quickly
into the new one that the act of transference is difficult to
follow. After walking about with the new shell it sometimes proves
to be unsatisfactory and further search becomes necessary. After it
is well domiciled the crab never ventures outside the shell until
it is obliged to change again on account of growth, or because
some stronger crab dispossesses him. The shells of hermit-crabs
serve frequently as the home of other animals which live with
them a commensal life. The hydroid <em class="e000I2">Hydractinia
polyclina</em> often covers the exterior of such shells with a
brown, velvety growth. Some sea-anemones also are commensals <a
id="pg267"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg267]</span> with hermits.
<em class="e000I2">Adamsia palliata</em> is always found on the
shell occupied by <em class="e000I2">Eupagurus prideaux</em>, and
never on any other. This is a European form. On our own coast a red
anemone, the <em class="e000I2">Epizoanthus americanus</em>, found
in deep water off the entire eastern shore, fastens on the shell
occupied by the hermits <em class="e000I2">Eupagurus pubescens</em>
and <em class="e000I2">E. kroyeri</em>. This anemone in time
absorbs the shell of its host and itself becomes its protector—an
advantage to the hermit, who finds room in the yielding polyp-mass
for its increasing size, and feels no longer the necessity for
change of domicile. The female hermit holds its eggs in the
posterior feet until they are hatched; the young are then released,
pass into the water, and soon find shells for themselves.</p>

<a id="pg271"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg271]</span>  spiny armature. The antennæ are broad at the base and covered with
small spines on the sides and upper surface, and the eye-stalks are also
spiny. This crab sometimes attains the size of ten inches across the
carapace and a weight of seven pounds, being among the largest crabs
known. It is found at the mouth of the Columbia River and along the
northwest coast. (<a href="#Plate-LXII">Plate LXII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. foriminatus.</em> This species resembles <em class="e000I2">E. cibarius</em> in the manner
of closing the feet, forming a compact, box-like, spiny armature.
The body is more depressed than that of the latter, and the cone-like
elevations on the back are less prominent. The spines are hairy. The
characteristic feature of this species is a semicircular cut in the second
joints of the chelipeds, directly opposite to similar depressions in the first
walking-legs, so that when the feet are folded a round hole is left,
through which water flows freely to the gill-openings, which might, without
these open holes, be obstructed by the close folding of the legs
against the carapace. Found off the California coast near San Francisco.

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em> <em class="eBU003">BRACHYURA</em><span class="smaller">
THE CRABS</span></p>

<p>This group contains the true crabs, which are the highest of
the <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em>. In form they are quite the reverse of the first
group. In the <em class="e000I2">Macrura</em>—except in the anomalous forms—the
body is long and cylindrical and the abdomen extended, but
in the <em class="e000I2">Brachyura</em> the body is flat and broad and the abdomen
short and reflexed. Crabs of this suborder inhabit all seas of the
globe, and are found from the shore to great depths. Some species
live on land, some on the shore, some in deep water. Some
forms burrow in the sand; others live under stones and boulders,
or conceal themselves in crevices of rocks or in the cavities of
sponges. They are divided into many families, and creep, climb,
swim, or burrow, their structure being modified to their respective
modes of life. There is also great variation in their shapes
as well as in their color and markings. This diversity is so great
and peculiar that it seems as though each one were more curious
than the others.</p>

<p>In crabs the cephalothorax is depressed and often broader than
long. The abdomen is relatively small and is folded under the
thorax, lying in a groove which it fits so perfectly as to be quite
hidden from above. The appendages of the abdomen are much
reduced in number. The male has two pairs; the female has four
pairs, which it uses for carrying its eggs. The first pair of walking-legs
are comparatively large, and end in chelæ, or pinching-claws.
The other eight legs terminate in simple points, except
in the swimming varieties, when the fifth pair is flattened to form
fins, or swimming-paddles. The eye-stalks are long and fit into
sockets on the carapace. Both pairs of feelers are small. The
antennules are frequently folded into small grooves. The external
or third pair of maxillipeds are broad and flat, and cover the
mouth-parts like a lid, or operculum. <a id="pg273"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg273]</span></p>

<p>Crabs, like other crustaceans, are scavengers, living on dead animal
matter; but the land species are also vegetarian in diet. They
are great fighters, but are also wily, often averting danger by
resorting to stratagem. They are an interesting and curious
group, as they possess a good degree of intelligence and have
amusing habits.</p>

<p>From the time they leave the egg until they attain the adult
form they pass through several complete and singular metamorphoses.
The most marked forms are called the <em class="e000I2">Zoëa</em> and the <em class="e000I2">Megalops</em>.
So little do these resemble the adult that originally they
were classed as distinct genera far removed from the one to which
they really belong. After the larva has moulted several times it
appears as in the illustration on <a href="#pg248">page 248</a>—the last zoëa stage.
From this it changes directly to <em class="e000I2">Megalops</em>; the <em class="e000I2">Zoëa</em>, seeming to be
attacked with violent convulsions, wriggles out of its skin a full
<em class="e000I2">Megalops</em> (<a href="#pg248">page 248</a>). The animal then has enormous eyes, an extended
abdomen, an elongated carapace, and swimming-legs. This
stage is a short one, and at the first moulting changes to a form
nearly approaching the adult. From this time they grow by
shedding the shell at certain periods. This shedding is supposed
to occur twice each summer until they have reached full growth,
after which it is probable that they do not again moult; for often
they are found with extraneous organisms, such as barnacles and
sponges, upon them, of a size that must have required a considerable
period of time for growth. The sexes of the same species
sometimes differ so much that it is difficult to classify them.
Even naturalists have been led into the error of assigning the
male and female to separate species.</p>

<p>The front side margins of the carapace in many crabs are edged
with a row of teeth or with spines, which vary in number and
character in different species. In the spider-crabs the whole surface
of the carapace is generally studded with tubercles, spines,
and stiff hairs of a peculiar character. This armature is for protective
purposes, and is often used to secure foreign bodies, such
as algæ, hydroids, and polyzoans, which the crabs place upon their
backs to disguise themselves. The burrowing crabs are usually
smooth. When in motion the crab moves sideways, using the legs <a id="pg274"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg274]</span>
of one side to pull with and those of the other side to push with.
As all the legs do not move at the same time, a continuous and
uniform motion is kept up. Some species move with great rapidity,
notably the sand-crab, <em class="e000I2">Ocypoda arenaria</em>. Often when pursued
they will run into the surf instead of to their holes. The
common edible crab, <em class="e000I2">Callinectes sapidus</em>, of the Atlantic coast, the
fiddler-crabs, and the spider-crabs are among the well-known
representatives of <em class="e000I2">Brachyura</em>.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. sapidus</em> (Mary J. Rathbun), <em class="eB00I2">C. hastatus</em> (Stimpson), the blue crab.
This is the common edible crab of the Atlantic coast. It is known
at the North as the "blue crab," and at the South as the "sea-crab." It is
found from Cape Cod to Florida, and after the lobster is the crustacean
which has the greatest commercial value, being taken in immense quantities
for the markets, not only when the shell is hard, but immediately
after moulting, before the new shell has hardened, when it is known as
the "soft-shelled crab." It inhabits muddy shores, and is common in
bays and at the mouths of estuaries. The carapace is about twice as
broad as it is long, and has a long, sharp spine on each side which projects
outward. This is a distinguishing feature. There are eight short
spines on each side between the long spines and the eyes; then come
recesses for the eyes, and between the eyes are four unequal teeth and a
small spine underneath. The chelæ are large and somewhat unequal in
size; then come three pairs of simple feet and a fifth pair, which are flattened,
forming swimming-organs. The margins of the carapace and
abdomen are fringed with fine hairs, as are also most of the joints of the
limbs. The upper surface of the body and claws is dark green in color,
the lower surface is dingy white, the feet blue, and the tips of the spines
reddish. The body is compressed, the carapace being moderately convex
above, and is covered with minute granulations, which are more numerous
over some portions than over others. The abdomen of the female is
very broad and fills the entire space between the bases of the posterior
pair of feet. During the spawning season it is so charged with eggs
that often it projects out almost at right angles with the carapace. The
<a id="pg276"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg276]</span> crabs of this species are very active and can swim rapidly. They also
have the habit of pushing themselves backward into the mud for concealment.
They are predaceous and pugnacious, and have great strength
in their claws, which they use with dexterity. They not only fight their
own kind, but show a bold front to all enemies, including man. The
average size is six inches across the carapace.</p></div>

Cape Cod to Florida. It is found among the loose sands at low-water
mark, even on the most exposed beaches, and also is abundant on sandy
bottoms offshore. At low-water mark it buries itself up to the eyes
and antennæ in the sand, where it watches for prey and foes, and quickly
disappears beneath the sand when danger approaches. It possesses the
power of burrowing in common with other marine animals which inhabit
exposed beaches of loose sand. By burying itself deep in the sand it is
protected from the action of the breakers. This species is easily distinguished
by the color and shape of its carapace, taken in connection
with its posterior swimming-feet. The body is nearly as long as it is
broad, with five prominent spines on each side. The front margin is
indented on each side of a three-spined rostrum, to form cavities for the
eyes. The first limbs are large and have claws; the posterior ones are
flattened into swimming-feet, and the intermediate three pairs are simple
in structure, ending in points. In color it is white, covered with

found from South Carolina to Texas. These crabs are edible, and in
some localities are hunted for food, one manner of capturing them being
to thrust the hand and arm into their holes and drag them out, an operation

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. arenaria</em>, the sand-&#160;or ghost-crab. The name <em class="e000I2">Ocypoda</em> means
"swift-footed," and, as it implies, this species is especially noted for its
rapidity of movement. These crabs are the opposite of the strong-armed,
thick-shelled, slow-moving <em class="e000I2">Cancroidæ</em>. An instance is told of a collector
having great difficulty to keep up at full run with one which he chased for a
considerable distance over the sand. They are also dexterous in burrowing,
and live in holes, often three feet deep, dug perpendicularly into the
sand. They wander far from their burrows when the tide is out, and
every little while raise their stalked eyes and stand on tiptoe to look
about. If alarmed, they run with great rapidity to the nearest burrow,
or, if danger is close, press themselves on the sand until an attempt is
made to touch them, when they again dart away rapidly, and in running
hold their bodies high, and double and dodge so that it is difficult to
catch them. <em class="e000I2">Ocypoda</em> is colored almost exactly like the sand, and this
mimicry, together with its fleetness, makes it interesting to note and
difficult to capture. It inhabits sandy beaches above tide-mark from
Long Island to Brazil, and subsists largely upon the beach-fleas, which
inhabit the same localities. It springs upon them, very much as a cat
catches a mouse. The carapace of this species is almost square in outline,
and on the anterior corners ends in a spine. A small portion of the
carapace folds down like a band between the eyes. On each side of this
band, and extending across the front, are large grooves for the eye-stalks.
The body is about an inch thick; the first joints of the chelæ
are toothed; one chela is a little longer than the other, and both are
coarsely granulated. The other four pairs of legs are thickly fringed
with hairs. (<a href="#Plate-LXIII">Plate LXIII.</a>)</p></div>

<a id="pg283"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg283]</span>  of fiddler-crabs occur on the Atlantic coast. They congregate in
immense numbers, and excavate their holes in convenient localities
above the reach of the tides—on salt-marshes, far up the estuaries, and
along the mouths of rivers, even where the water is quite fresh. The
males have one claw very largely developed; the other chela is small.
The former is likened to a fiddle, the latter to a bow, and this, together
with the waving motion of the large claw, gives them their popular
name. This comparatively enormous claw is a distinguishing feature by
which they are easily recognized without other description. The female
has claws of small and equal size. These crabs burrow holes in the
mud or sand half
an inch to two
inches in diameter
and a foot or more
in depth. The
upper part is nearly
perpendicular, becoming
horizontal
below, with a chamber
at the end. One
species, <em class="e000I2">U. minax</em>,
constructs an archway
over the mouth
of its burrow, in
which it sits and
surveys the surroundings, but quickly retreats when danger approaches.
The crab makes its burrow by scraping up the mud or sand and forming it
into pellets, which it carries under the three anterior walking-feet on the
under side, using the legs on the side moving forward, and the fourth
one on the other side, to climb out of the hole. After peering cautiously
about, the crab emerges, and carries its load four or five feet away
before dropping it; then again looks about before quickly running
back; and, finally, turning its stalked eyes, looks in all directions and
suddenly disappears, soon to return with another load. The burrows
cover considerable areas, and the crabs are so abundant that the marshes
and shores sometimes seem to be alive with them. When alarmed, they
lift the large claw and run sideways, after the manner of all crabs, to
their holes, and, as many are likely to retreat into the most convenient
one, the owner often finds his burrow occupied by other tenants, whom
he unceremoniously proceeds to pull out. <em class="e000I2">U. minax</em> ranges from southern
New England to Florida, and lives on salt-marshes farther away from
the sea than the others, and often where the water is quite fresh. It is
larger than the other species, and can be distinguished by a red patch at
the joints of the legs. It is a vegetarian in diet, living on small algæ.
This is the species which constructs a little observation-house over the
mouth of its burrow. It can live out of water, and without food, for several
days. <em class="e000I2">U. pugilator</em> lives on sandy and muddy flats and beaches near
high-water mark, where the sand is compact and somewhat sheltered,
and ranges from Cape Cod to Florida. This species, like <em class="e000I2">U. minax</em>, is a
vegetarian. <em class="e000I2">U. pugnax</em> is exceedingly abundant on muddy banks and
ditches of salt-marshes, the banks being sometimes completely honeycombed
and undermined by them. It ranges from Cape Cod to Florida. <a id="pg284"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg284]</span></p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">MAIIDÆ</em></p>

<p>The members of this family are known as "spider-crabs."
Their bodies are thick and more or less round in form, narrowing
in front to a long, beak-like projection. The surface is generally
rough and irregular, having tubercles, spines, prickles, and hairs.
The legs are long. These crabs are often covered with seaweeds,
hydroids, and other organisms, which they gather with their long
and flexible chelipeds and place upon their backs, presumably to
conceal themselves from their enemies. They seem to select,
instinctively or with reason, such things as will bear transplanting,
sometimes using sponges and polyps which are not destroyed
by being torn apart, and they also select their dress with reference
to its masking uses. A <em class="e000I2">Hyas</em> covered with bright-colored
algæ was seen to remove them and replace them with sponges,
when transferred to the locality of the latter, where the
former did not grow. The animal takes in his claw the object
he has gathered, and first holds it to his mouth, where it is
moistened with a secretion of mucus or cement, and then places
it on his back. If it does not hold, the operation is repeated,
often several times, a new spot on the shell being selected each
time. It has also been found that the coats of these crabs are
covered with hairs which are differently arranged in different
genera, some being hooked, others serrated, etc., and that
these aid in holding the transplanted organisms in place. The
crab is sometimes so covered with these growths as to be entirely
concealed beneath them. It is a sluggish animal, and inhabits
shallow water along the whole of the Atlantic and Pacific coasts.</p>

are smaller than the female, have a

in helping to provide food for its host. This crab, like the rest,
holds its eggs in the posterior feet until hatched, when the larvæ leave the
parent and swim about for a while. The females, at the megalops stage,
enter oysters—sometimes two enter the same oyster, but seldom more
than one; there it remains permanently, growing to the size of an inch
or more in diameter, and becomes a degenerate. The eyes become
smaller; the shell never hardens, like its allies which live in open water;
its limbs and chelæ are weak; and it has no pugnacity, the protection
afforded by the oyster doing away with the need for the common protective

as to seem like skeletons, are found in abundance clinging to hydroids,
<em class="e000I2">Polyzoa</em>, delicate algæ, or eel-grass, or under stones in tide-pools.
They resemble in color, and often in form, the objects on which they
live. Holding on by the posterior
feet, they extend the body
out rigidly or sway it about, so
that they resemble little sticks
or branches, and often escape
detection. In walking, they
bring the hind feet up to the
front ones, doubling the body
into a loop like the canker-&#160;or measuring-worm. The appendages on
the anterior and posterior ends are furnished with chelæ and hooks;
those of the middle section are rudimentary. This animal cannot be
mistaken for any other. <em class="e000I2">C. geometrica</em> is found from Cape Cod to North
Carolina. Some of the species of this genus may be found on every
coast.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em> <em class="eBU003">ISOPODA</em></p>

<p>The isopods have an elongate, flattened, but more or less
arched body, composed of seven thoracic segments and a short
abdomen of six segments. The six segments of the abdomen
are smaller than those of the thorax, and are often more or less
united, sometimes into a single piece with scarcely any trace of
division above; but the number of pairs of appendages is generally
six, showing the composite nature of the apparently simple
organ. The last segment, or telson, is broad and has a pair of
modified appendages. The seven thoracic legs are not all equal,
as the name would imply, but vary greatly in different species. As
a rule, they are adapted to walking or attachment, and in the female
some have delicate plates which form brood-pouches. The
swimming-feet fold under the abdomen, and in some species are
inclosed by the first pair, which are large and plate-like, and form
a complete cover for the others. The isopods are a large and
widely distributed order, varying in size, and are inconspicuous
because they cling closely to objects. They are retiring in habit,
though extremely ferocious.</p>

<p>The sow-bugs or pill-bugs, common in gardens, under leaves in
the woods, and under almost any pile of rubbish among decaying
vegetable matter, are a land species of isopods. Other species inhabit
<a id="pg292"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg292]</span> ponds and streams of fresh water, and still others are found
along the shores of all oceans, abounding among the marine vegetation
of the shallow waters. Some swim free in the open sea;
others are brought up from the greatest depths. Others, again,
are parasites, and live in the internal organs of fishes and prawns.
Sometimes a prawn is found having what appears like a very
swollen throat, which actually is a little parasitic isopod of the
family <em class="e000I2">Bopyridæ</em> attached to its gills.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. concharum.</em> The body consists of fourteen segments, the first
being the head, the next seven the thorax, and the last six the abdomen.
On the head are the triangular eyes, the antennules, and
the antennæ, and underneath is the mouth, which is
covered by the maxillipeds. The dorsal surface is more
or less rounded. At the bases of all the segmental thoracic
rings excepting the first one are sutures marking off square,
scale-like pieces (<em class="e000I2">epimera</em>). The epimera form a border
to the side margins. The legs are attached to the epimera,
which are, in fact, the upper segments of the legs. The
first three pairs of legs have a general resemblance to one
another, and are directed forward. The last four pairs are
much longer and flatter, and are directed backward. The
telson, or last segment, is triangular, and the square or
blunt apex is fringed with hairs. On the ventral surface
of the thorax in the adult females there is a long pouch
for the reception and development of the eggs. This species
is usually about one and a half inches in length, but sometimes is
longer. Its color is yellowish, with a brown edge on the posterior margins
of the segments, somewhat translucent in the thinner parts. It is found
from Cape Cod to South Carolina, swimming about in
shallow water, and is especially abundant in winter.</p></div>

destructive in its habits, boring into submerged woodwork,
like the ship-worm (Teredo), and doing great
damage to the piles of wharves, etc. It burrows to the
depth of half an inch, and completely honeycombs the
surface of the wood, which then scales off or rapidly
decays, and is washed away by the waves. The animal
then begins anew, and in a short time, or at the rate of
about an inch a year, piles diminish in diameter where
<em class="e000I2">Limnoria</em> is plentiful, and are finally destroyed unless protected from
these little crustaceans by a sheathing of metal. Although considered
as pests, they have an economic value not so often recognized, as they
attack all driftwood, and in time entirely destroy floating and water-logged
<a id="pg293"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg293]</span> timber, which without their destructive agency might become
serious obstructions to navigation. <em class="e000I2">Limnoria</em> is only the fifth of an inch
in length, and its back is covered with minute hairs, to which dirt usually
adheres. It burrows with its mandibles, or jaws, which are chisel-like

coast.</p></div>

to which this species belongs is derived from the
peculiar habit of many of the species of rolling themselves
into a ball when alarmed. The body is so
constructed as to admit of this singular change of
shape. The abdomen turns under, and the last
abdominal appendages, together with the narrow
epimera, shut in the legs and cover the ventral
portions with armor. The body, when extended, is an ellipse a little
over a quarter of an inch in length and half that in breadth. The legs
are hairy and adapted to walking. The anterior abdominal segments
are fused into one, but are marked at the sides with depressed lines.
The abdominal feet are plate-like and fringed with hairs. A slight
elevation runs around the margins of the animal like a border. The
color is variable. Some are a uniform slaty gray; others are marked
with a longitudinal patch of color on the
back. It is found from Cape Cod to Florida
among algæ or rocks, and is easily recognized
by its habit of rolling itself into a
ball. <em class="eB00I2">Sphæroma destructor</em> is a boring
isopod, larger than <em class="e000I2">Limnoria</em>, and is even

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. polyphemus</em>, the horseshoe-&#160;or king-crab. This well-known and
curious animal ranges along the Atlantic coast from Maine to Mexico.
<a id="pg295"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg295]</span> It lives on sandy and muddy shores below low-water mark, where it burrows
beneath the surface. At the breeding season—May, June, and
July—it comes ashore to deposit its eggs near high-water mark. The
crabs come up the beach in pairs, the male being the smaller and riding
on the back of the female, holding on by short feet provided with nippers,
which are peculiar to the males. Sometimes the female is accompanied
by several males, each one holding on to the tail of another
and forming a string of animals. After the female has deposited her
eggs in a hole excavated by her for the purpose, the male covers them
with milt, and they then return to the water, leaving the eggs to be buried
in the sand by the action of the waves. The eggs hatch in July and
August, and sometimes the beach is literally alive with the young crabs,
which, however, soon disappear,
and are not seen again until they
are well grown. After the
spawning season the adults are
not very often seen, but usually
their empty shells, abandoned
in moulting, may be found on
the shore. The horseshoe-crab,
also called king-crab, is especially
interesting from the fact
that it is the last survivor of
an otherwise extinct group of
animals. Its relationships with
classes which have become extinct,
its nearest relatives being
fossils, make it difficult to classify
definitely with existing forms.
Formerly it was regarded as a
crustacean; now it is classed by
some authors with the <em class="e000I2">Arachnida</em>,
along with scorpions and spiders.
It has the characteristics
of both groups. There are only
two known species of <em class="e000I2">Limulus</em>
in the world; the other, <em class="eB00I2">Limulus moluccanus</em>, lives on the
eastern coast of Asia. <em class="e000I2">L. polyphemus</em>
often measures a foot in
diameter. The body is composed
of three parts. The front
portion, or cephalothorax, is
broad and semicircular, with
posterior angles ending in
points. Near each side of its
dorsal surface is a pair of large
compound eyes covered with
thickened cuticle, and near the center line of the shell, at the base of the
first spine, a pair of small, simple eyes. The second portion is the abdomen,
and the third a long, movable spine attached to the last segment
of the abdomen and between two terminal points of the horn-like covering.
<a id="pg296"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg296]</span> On the cephalothorax are seven pairs of appendages. The first pair are
small and lie in front of the mouth; these and the four following pairs have
chelæ, or claws. The sixth pair have no chelæ, but at the base have a peculiar
process termed the flabellum. These six pairs of appendages surround
the mouth, and have bristles at the base which serve as jaws. The seventh
pair of thoracic appendages are broad plates called the operculum,
which meet and cover the abdominal appendages to a certain extent.
The abdomen has five pairs of appendages, which are plate-like and resemble
the operculum in form and have an upper and an under piece.
On the posterior surfaces of the abdominal feet are large, leaf-like folds,
which are the gills. In front of the first pair of thoracic legs is a small
tubercle supposed to have an olfactory function. <em class="e000I2">Limulus</em> has a blood-vascular
system (the blood being bluish in color), a nervous and a digestive
system. It walks with the thoracic feet and swims with the abdominal
ones. It enters the sand by pushing in the rounded, anterior end.
In moulting the carapace opens on the front edge. <em class="e000I2">Limulus</em> is edible, its
meat being, it is said, as good as that of the lobster. (<a href="#Plate-LXIV">Plate LXIV.</a>)</p></div>

of marine organisms. About one hundred and fifty species of
<em class="e000I2">Pycnogonida</em> have been described, of
which thirty are found on our coast and are commonly known as
sea-spiders. They are found crawling slowly over seaweeds,
hydroids, and sponges, and appear to be all legs, but, like
other animals, have a digestive, a circulatory, and a nervous
system. They are devoid of organs of respiration. The body has a
cephalothorax, which bears a conical suctorial proboscis on the
anterior end, and on top a prominence containing four eyes. It
has three pairs of appendages, two pairs of which are sometimes
lacking; then come three free segments and a rudimentary abdomen.
There is a pair of short appendages bearing claws (chelæ) and
four pairs of long walking-legs. The walking-legs contain a
tubular outgrowth of the body, into which the stomach extends.
The egg-sacs are in the legs, and open at the basal joints. The
male is provided with an extra pair of legs, for the purpose of
carrying the eggs after they are deposited by the female. The <a
id="pg297"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg297]</span> ovigerous legs
are run through sac-like pockets and bent under the body, and thus

<h4 title="Mollusks"><a id="pg305"></a>MOLLUSKS</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>We now come to another large and important group of animals,
with characters so peculiar to itself and differing so
radically from those which distinguish any other class of living
creatures, that it may be said to occupy almost a unique position
in the animal kingdom. Recent investigations have demonstrated
that the larval form of mollusks presents some remarkable
points of similarity to the embryonic forms of the <em class="e000I2">Annelida</em>
and to the larvæ of some other classes of lower organisms.
This discovery is one of the triumphs of embryology in its patient
search for that connecting-thread that weaves together all the
varying forms of animal life. Aside from these subtle evidences
of relationship revealed by the microscope, the mollusks appear
to occupy a position of considerable isolation in the biological
world.</p>

<p>As accepted by zoölogists to-day, this phylum is but the remnant
of its former self. Aristotle considered all creatures with
a testaceous covering to belong to a single family, and those
later patriarchs of biology, Linnæus, Cuvier, and Lamarck, extended
the group to include the greater part of all the marine
invertebrate animals. Little by little the phylum has been shorn
of orders and classes. First, the worms and the <em class="e000I2">Echinodermata</em>
were separated into distinct phyla; then the barnacles were discovered
to be crustaceans, and were accordingly removed from
their position as "multivalves" under the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>; then the
tunicates, or ascidians, were found, through the critical examination
of their larval stage, to be merely masquerading as mollusks;
and lastly, the brachiopods have been somewhat reluctantly removed
from their old position with the mollusks and given the <a id="pg306"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg306]</span>
distinction of a phylum almost exclusively to themselves: they
retain their old associations only in the name of <em class="e000I2">Molluscoida</em>.</p>

<p>With some exceptions, all mollusks secrete from their outer
skin, or mantle fold, a calcareous protective covering, or shell.
This may be either "univalve" or "bivalve" according as it consists
of one or two pieces. This phylum includes all the
sea-shells which are so commonly found along every ocean beach, in
the tide-pools, on rocks at low tide, in estuaries, and, indeed,
wherever sea-water is present. The phylum also includes,
as one of its large suborders, all the snails and slugs that are
to be found crawling upon the land. These are true mollusks,
which differ essentially from their marine brethren only in that
they breathe by means of a pulmonary sac or lung instead of by
gills. There are also many genera and species of mollusks that
find their habitat only in the fresh water of rivers, lakes, or ponds;
curiously enough, many of these fresh-water forms, like the
purely terrestrial snails and slugs, are air-breathers, possessing no
gills whatever, and are consequently obliged to make periodic
visits to the surface of the water to obtain their necessary supply
of oxygen. There are also numerous forms of mollusks that are
entirely deprived of a shell covering; and, again, there are intermediate
types between these two extremes that produce only more
or less developed rudimentary shells. Notwithstanding these
variations in the matter of a shell covering,—an important consideration
in this phylum,—by reason of their anatomical features
these "naked" forms are mollusks quite as much as are those
that secrete the most highly developed tests.</p>

<p>The marvelous beauty of sea-shells and tropical land-shells,
their almost infinite variety in form and coloring, has given to
them an interest among collectors that is very great. There are
many wonderful conchological collections in public museums and
in private cabinets. It would well repay the lover of beauty as
well as the more serious student of nature to examine carefully
such collections when opportunity offers, for nowhere in the realm
of nature can more exquisite coloring and modeling be found. The
fact that shells may be preserved for all time without the expense
and the vexations of preservative fluids has no doubt induced many <a id="pg307"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg307]</span>
to choose this field of natural history for special study. But the
true student of zoölogy does not confine his investigations in this
phylum to considerations of the shell only, for the protective
armor constitutes only a portion, although an important portion,
of the anatomy of the mollusk. On the same principle, it would
hardly suffice to examine only the skeleton of vertebrate animals
in order to become acquainted with the fishes or mammals. In a
sense, the testaceous covering of a mollusk may be likened to an
outer skeleton.</p>

<p>The older zoölogists were inclined to ignore almost entirely
the animal or "soft parts" of mollusks, and their classification
of the phylum into "univalve," "bivalve," and "multivalve,"
based upon shell-characters alone, has since been proved to be
wholly artificial. The terms "univalve" and "bivalve" are, of
course, often and correctly used to-day to designate mollusks
possessing a single or a double shell, such as the common garden-snail,
which carries upon its back a single spiral shell, and, on
the other hand, the oyster or clam, which is inclosed within two
valves which fit closely together. But these terms are not
<em class="e000I2">technically</em> used, although they do indicate in a general way the
more modern classification. Even among some comparatively
recent conchologists a tendency to belittle the value of the
"slimy creature" within the shell has led to some curious errors
of grouping—mistakes which more thorough and scientific investigation
has brought to light. In general, the higher classification
into classes, orders, suborders, and families is exclusively
based upon anatomical features, and to a large extent, also, is
that of the genera; but species are always determined by their
shell or conchological characteristics.</p>

<p>When a certain familiarity with the forms and general appearance
of shells is gained, a glance at the shell alone will almost
always suffice to place it at once in its true generic position, for,
along with modifications of the animal itself, corresponding modifications
of the shell are quite certain to take place. Hence a
fairly expert zoölogist should be able to determine with considerable
accuracy from an empty and dead shell the anatomical
features of the animal that at one time inhabited it. <a id="pg308"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg308]</span></p>

<p>One of the main reasons for the special interest that seems to
have attached to the study of conchology is derived from the
fact that the durability of shells has caused their almost perfect
preservation as fossils from the very earliest periods of geological
time, thus furnishing the key to the solution of many problems of
evolution. Upon this page of the earth's history the letters are
sharp and clear, and geologists possessing a knowledge of recent
forms of mollusks as well as of their geographical distribution
have been enabled to read some wonderful stories of the cosmic
history of islands and continents.</p>

<h5>GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION</h5>

<p>Mollusks are found in every part of the world. The arctic
seas possess their own characteristic faunæ, the more temperate
waters of Europe and of America contain their own peculiar
genera and species, and the warm waters of the tropic seas furnish
the conditions favorable to the life of an immense number of
characteristic forms. Again, there are the littoral species, that
live only between tide-marks and are therefore exposed to the
air for a number of hours each day; some of these live just about
high-tide mark and have become almost terrestrial in their habits,
while others must be sought at the point of lowest tide, where
for only a short time each day they are deprived of their natural
element. Then there are the shallow-water forms, which never
appear above low-tide mark save when a neap tide surprises them;
their range in depth extends to about the hundred-fathom line,
more or less. Beyond this depth to several hundred fathoms
other characteristic forms appear, and from the more profound
depths of mid-ocean the dredge has brought to light a host of
curious and interesting species.</p>

<p>It is the temperature of the water rather than the depth that
appears to influence the distribution of marine mollusks. Thus,
certain species whose natural home is in the shallow waters of the
Arctic Ocean have been taken in very deep waters off the southern
coast of the United States, the temperature conditions in both
stations being substantially the same. This fact, however, must
not be too freely accepted as establishing a principle. Some <a id="pg309"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg309]</span>
shallow-water forms have been taken at great depths, but in
general the abyssal fauna is a peculiar one that cannot well be
marked off into geographical provinces.</p>

<h5>THE ARCTIC PROVINCE</h5>

<p>The east coast of America is divided into several molluscan
faunal regions. A series of very-cold-water forms belonging to
a circumpolar region, called the "arctic province," are found as
far south as Newfoundland. On the New England coast a number
of these arctic species are also found, urged south by the
influence of the cold Labrador current. The most characteristic
genera belonging to this arctic fauna which are found upon the
Maine and Massachusetts coasts are <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>, <em class="e000I2">Chrysodomus</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Sipho</em>, <em class="e000I2">Trophon</em>, <em class="e000I2">Bela</em>, <em class="e000I2">Velutina</em>, <em class="e000I2">Trichotropis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Lacuna</em>, <em class="e000I2">Margarita</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>, <em class="e000I2">Leda</em>, <em class="e000I2">Yoldia</em>, <em class="e000I2">Astarte</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Mya</em>. Examples of all these
genera are encountered as far south as Cape Cod.</p>

<h5>THE BOREAL PROVINCE</h5>

<p>A "boreal province" corresponds with a similar faunal region
upon the European shore. The mollusks which compose this
fauna are about three hundred in number, and range along the
New England coast from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Cape Cod.
It is a somewhat remarkable fact that many of these species are
identical with English and French forms. The striking genera
upon the American side are <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>, <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em>, <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em> (<em class="e000I2">Lunatia</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Neverita</em>), <em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em>, <em class="e000I2">Margarita</em>, <em class="e000I2">Chiton</em>, <em class="e000I2">Doris</em>, <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Mytilus</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Modiola</em>, <em class="e000I2">Thracia</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Nucula</em>.</p>

<h5>THE TRANSATLANTIC PROVINCE</h5>

<p>Cape Cod has been regarded, until very recently, as a sharp
divisional point between the boreal and the transatlantic provinces,
the latter faunal area extending down the Atlantic coast of
the United States to southern Florida. At Cape Cod the Labrador
current is deflected from the coast, and the warmer shore waters
south of that point are unfitted for the development of the boreal
forms, though some of them, as we shall see, have passed the <a id="pg310"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg310]</span>
barrier and maintain themselves very successfully at Martha's
Vineyard and in Long Island Sound. Some of the species whose
natural habitat is south of Cape Cod are also to be found north
of that point, but they do not reach their full development in the
colder waters of Massachusetts Bay.</p>

<p>The long stretch of coast-line from Cape Cod to Florida is
easily susceptible of faunal subdivision at Hatteras, below which
locality a decided mixture of Antillean species is apparent. Between
Long Island Sound and Hatteras the littoral molluscan
fauna is disappointing to the collector, for the number of species
is relatively small, and few even of these are entitled to any claims
to beauty of shell. The nature of this coast, virtually a great
sweep of exposed sand-beach, is not conducive to a varied or rich
fauna. But if this portion of the transatlantic province is lacking
in interest to the shell-collector, it is anything but disappointing
to the army of men employed in the oyster-&#160;and clam-fishery.
It is only within this faunal area that the American oyster, <em class="e000I2">Ostrea
virginica</em>, the best of the edible shell-fish, finds its natural home,
and here the oyster-culture is most extensively carried on.</p>

<p>After storms the Jersey beaches are frequently strewn with
<em class="e000I2">Mactra</em>, <em class="e000I2">Tagelus</em>, <em class="e000I2">Arca</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Ensis</em>; in more sheltered places <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em> (<em class="e000I2">Lunatia</em>) are commonly met. These may be accepted
as the most characteristic genera of this province.</p>

<p>Just south of Cape Hatteras an observer is struck with the
sudden change in the appearance of the shells on the beach.
<em class="e000I2">Cardium</em>, <em class="e000I2">Cassis</em>, <em class="e000I2">Dolium</em>, <em class="e000I2">Arca</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Cancellaria</em> at once suggest
the West Indies. About the vicinity of Hatteras the Gulf Stream
approaches very near the land, bringing with its warm waters
many wanderers from tropical homes. From Beaufort to Florida
there is another long stretch of exposed and shifting sand-beach,
which offers a scant return to the collector of mollusks.</p>

<h5>THE CARIBBEAN PROVINCE</h5>

<p>When Florida is reached a new world is opened to the naturalist,
for there a better acquaintance is made with the great Caribbean
province, which, extending from Florida to the northern
shores of South America, embraces all the Bahamas, the West <a id="pg311"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg311]</span>
Indies, the Gulf of Mexico, and the coast of Central America.
Strangely enough, the mollusks of the west coast of Florida are
more nearly related to those of the transatlantic province than
are the shells of the east Florida coast. This remarkable fact in
geographical distribution can only be explained by assuming that
an open waterway once existed across the northern part of the
Florida peninsula, connecting the Atlantic and the Gulf, through
which a mingling of the shallow-water forms from Georgia, the
Carolinas, West Florida, and the Gulf coast took place. Thus it
would appear that when Florida was an island the fauna of its
east coast, originally largely Antillean, was less disturbed by the
southern migration of American species. The Florida Keys are
essentially Antillean. The Caribbean or Antillean fauna is an
exceedingly rich and varied one. Among the most prominent
genera which may be encountered upon the Florida coast are
<em class="e000I2">Strombus</em>, <em class="e000I2">Fasciolaria</em>, <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>, <em class="e000I2">Marginella</em>, <em class="e000I2">Natica</em>, <em class="e000I2">Sigaretus</em>, <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Tectarius</em>, <em class="e000I2">Neritina</em>, <em class="e000I2">Melongena</em>, <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em>, <em class="e000I2">Callista</em>, <em class="e000I2">Tellina</em>, <em class="e000I2">Lucina</em>,
and <em class="e000I2">Cyrena</em>. In such an extensive and rich faunal province one
must not expect to find in any given locality a representation of
all the characteristic genera. For instance, collections made at
Havana, at Nassau, and at Vera Cruz would each contain forms
more or less peculiar and local, but certain species would be found
in each collection.</p>

<p><br />On the west coast of America quite the same faunal division
into more or less well-marked provinces is to be found. Bering
Sea belongs to the arctic province, and contains, with Labrador
and Greenland, many identical forms.</p>

<h5>THE ALEUTIAN PROVINCE</h5>

<p>The shore waters from the southern peninsula of Alaska down
to about Vancouver comprise the Aleutian province. Within
this area occur some arctic species, notably the soft-shell clam,
<em class="e000I2">Mya arenaria</em>, which the fishermen gather in such large quantities
for bait along the Maine coast. An increasing number of
species common to this west-coast faunal region and to the
boreal province of the east coast are being recorded. Some of <a id="pg312"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg312]</span>
these have been introduced from the East by the agency of
man, but others no doubt have a natural range through the icy
waters north of America and down through the Bering Sea into
the Pacific.</p>

<h5>THE CALIFORNIAN PROVINCE</h5>

<p>The Californian province extends from the neighborhood of
Vancouver to Cape St. Lucas and has about five hundred species.
The northern portion of this area contains some very characteristic
forms, together with a good mixture of species of more
northern habitat; it might properly be regarded as a subprovince.
From San Diego south to the cape the character of the
fauna gradually changes; this coast-line of southern California
has also been considered a subregion. The main characteristic
of the Californian province is a large development of <em class="e000I2">Haliotis</em>, of
the patelliform mollusks, and of the chitons. A very few minutes
on any good collecting-beach of California would convince the
Eastern conchologist that he had entered upon an entirely new
field of research. The most notable genera are <em class="e000I2">Calliostoma</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Chlorostoma</em>, <em class="e000I2">Scurria</em>, <em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em>, various genera of the <em class="e000I2">Chitonidæ</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>, <em class="e000I2">Monoceras</em>, <em class="e000I2">Amphissa</em>, <em class="e000I2">Norrisia</em>, <em class="e000I2">Olivella</em>, <em class="e000I2">Chorus</em>, and
<em class="e000I2">Haliotis</em>.</p>

<h5>THE PANAMIC PROVINCE</h5>

<p>The warmer waters of the Gulf of California belong to the
Panamic province, which extends down to South America. This
is one of the richest and most interesting faunas in the world.
At Panama alone, Mr. C. B. Adams, a noted collector and
student of conchology, took upward of four hundred species.
About eight hundred species are known in the Gulf of California
alone.</p>

<p><br />It must be borne in mind that these faunal provinces relate to
littoral and shallow-water species, for the present knowledge of
deep-water forms is not sufficient to permit of generalization
upon their distribution.</p>

<p>We review here only the conspicuous forms along our own
coasts. It may be well to note, however, that in some other
parts of the world the development of molluscan life is far <a id="pg313"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg313]</span>
in excess of anything to be found upon our shores. The
veritable paradise of the naturalist is the East Indies. There
the "aristocratic" genera, so called on account of their marvelous
beauty, occur in their highest development—<em class="e000I2">Voluta</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Mitra</em>, <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>, <em class="e000I2">Conus</em>, and the various murices. There also are to
be found the pearl-oysters, <em class="e000I2">Meleagrina margaritifera</em>, that yield
their valuable harvest, and the giant clam, <em class="e000I2">Tridacna gigas</em>, which
measures sometimes five feet in length. Over eight thousand
species of mollusks are described from this surpassingly rich
region, yet this vast province, as compared with the American
and European shores, has been but superficially exploited by the
naturalist. In whatever part of the world a naturalist may
find himself, there is always a tempting array of molluscan life
to attract him. Each fauna possesses features peculiar to itself,
and from the point of view of the true naturalist, the more
somber-hued and conventionally formed mollusks of Northern
shores are no less interesting than the gorgeously tinted and
fantastically shaped species of the tropics. From any faunal
province of our own country one may readily gather all forms
necessary to furnish ample material for study from which one
may acquire an excellent idea of the biological features of the
entire phylum.</p>

<h5>STATION AND HABITS OF THE MOLLUSCA</h5>

<p>The word "station" is used to indicate the nature of the surroundings
which an animal chooses as most suited to his well-being.
Some groups of mollusks, like the littorinas, the trochids,
the purpuras, and the majority of those having patelliform shells,
generally live on rocks above low-tide mark; other genera, like
<em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>, <em class="e000I2">Sipho</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Chrysodomus</em>, prefer rocky or gravelly ground
below low-tide mark. Other mollusks burrow deep in the mud,
many prefer sandy bottoms, while a host of other species seek
homes upon the tangled masses of seaweed, living like arboreal
creatures in the submarine forests. Nearly every conceivable
character of sea-bottom or shore-line between tides harbors its
own peculiar types of molluscan life. There are some very curious
genera of bivalves that bore their way into the hardest rock and <a id="pg314"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg314]</span>
there find a comfortable shelter for life. A numerous class of
pelagic or free-swimming mollusks supposedly never go to the
bottom at all, but spend the whole of their existence on or near
the surface of the sea, always in open water, where their fragile
shells may not be injured by rough contact with solid substances.</p>

<p>The food of some is vegetable, of others, animal. The bivalves,
like the clams, oysters, cockles, and mussels, feed only on microscopic
organisms. They create a current of water through their
siphons, or mantle openings, and then, by a process best known to
themselves, catch and swallow all the animalculæ thus brought
to their mouths. The univalves which possess a siphon are, for
the most part, carnivorous, and are often most voracious creatures.
They feed upon any animal matter they can find, while some
of them are enabled by means of a sharply toothed tongue to bore
through the solid shells of other mollusks and extract the succulent
vitals from within. One energetic little mollusk in particular,
<em class="e000I2">Urosalpinx cinerea</em>, is for this reason a great pest upon the oyster-beds.
Univalves not possessed of a siphon may generally be
considered herbivorous; they pass most of their time peacefully
browsing upon algæ.</p>

<p>Mollusks are all oviparous or ovoviviparous; that is, they lay
eggs, or, laying eggs, they retain them within their shells until the
young are hatched out. As a rule, each species of mollusk has
its own particular method of protecting its eggs from external
injury. Some construct tough, leathery capsules which are strung
together in various patterns. The egg-capsules of <em class="e000I2">Purpura lapillus</em>,
resembling little pinkish or yellowish club-shaped stalks, may
frequently be found in the crevices of rocks and under the rockweeds.
The egg-cases of <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em> (<em class="e000I2">Lunatia</em>) are most peculiar,
resembling inverted gelatine-bowls with the bottom knocked out;
when wet they are semi-elastic translucent masses in which
may be seen myriads of eggs. <em class="e000I2">Buccinum undatum</em> arranges its
hemispherical egg-capsules in layers one above the other. The
number of eggs so deposited is often very great, running well into
the thousands. Egg-capsules of <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> are leathery coils of
angular disks adhering by one edge to a connecting-band of a
similar texture. (See <a href="#Plate-I">Plate I</a>.)
<a id="pg315"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg315]</span></p>

<p>In bivalves the eggs are retained within the parent shell until
hatched, and the young, which then escape into the water, are very
different-looking creatures from the parent. Generally the young
bivalve is free-swimming and exceedingly lively in its movements;
sometimes by means of cilia it is enabled to attach itself
to any passing host, and thus the species is widely disseminated.
The fry soon lose their embryonic form and take on the characteristics
of the adult.</p>

<p>The longevity of mollusks varies greatly with the species. Some
attain an age of from ten to fifteen years, while some are only
annuals. Oysters continue to grow for four or five years, after
which they may survive many years more. In truth, little is
known concerning the duration of life even of our better-known
shore species.</p>

<p>In point of intelligence, mollusks must be relegated to a very
low position. They give evidence of possessing no more than the
most primary instincts, those of self-preservation and of reproduction.
There are some forms that exercise a high degree of
protective mimicry. The highest class of mollusks, the <em class="e000I2">Cephalopoda</em>
(cuttlefishes, octopi, etc.), is widely separated from the other
classes in the development of faculties that appear to correspond
with intelligence. They are exceedingly crafty in the pursuit of
their prey as well as in eluding capture.</p>

<h5>STRUCTURE OF MOLLUSKS</h5>

<p>Among the invertebrate animals, especially in the lower orders,
wide physiological departures from central or typical forms
are frequent. It often happens that a whole group or even suborder
will differ so materially in its general characteristics from
another group or suborder belonging to the same phylum that the
student will be puzzled at first to understand how the two can be
nearly related. In many such cases it is only when the essential
features of the phylum are thoroughly understood that the
relationships of its suborders can be appreciated. An example
of widely divergent groups within the same phylum has already
been shown in the <em class="e000I2">Echinodermata</em>. Who would at first suppose
that the graceful <em class="e000I2">Astrophyton</em> could bear kinship to the inert <a id="pg316"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg316]</span>
holothurian, or that both of these have the closest family ties with
the sea-urchins?</p>

<p>The probable reason for these startling departures from a typical
form is that in the lower orders of life, where the organs and
their functions are comparatively simple, the laws of evolution
operate far more quickly in the adaptation of an organism to
environment and changed conditions of life. A decided tendency
to this departure from the type is a feature of the mollusks. It
would be difficult, if not impossible, to give a general description
that would fit both a common garden-snail and the common oyster,
yet both are mollusks. A concise definition of the phylum is therefore
practically impossible, and it seems here as if nature resented
all attempts to circumscribe her living forms by rigid rules.</p>

<p>The most persistent characteristic of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em> is the possession
of the "mantle," a sort of outer skin which, like a bag or sack,
envelops the creature above and about the sides, but is open
below, permitting the animal at will to protrude or withdraw its
foot. From the outer surface of this sheath-like mantle, or fold,
a calcareous shell is secreted. The modifications of this mantle
are infinite; indeed, in some well-marked groups it seems to
have wholly disappeared, having in reality become fused to the
sides of the animal, and having become therefore a mere outer
skin, and no longer a tunic or cloak, as originally intended. As
already noted, the mantle does not always secrete a shell, a fact
which again reminds us that we cannot give a good comprehensive
description of the phylum that always holds true throughout
its subdivisions. The best that can be done is to give in general
terms the characters which appear in a majority of the forms. A
convenient method of going about this is to create, for the sake of
clearness, an ideal, model, or fanciful mollusk and clothe it with all
the most salient molluscan features, and from such a basis to develop,
as we go on, the various types of the actual orders and suborders.
There is one class of mollusks, the <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>, which
conforms reasonably well in most of its features to our comprehension
of the schematic mollusk. This class is sometimes referred
to by biologists as the "primitive" or "original" mollusks, from
which all the other classes have since been derived; but the <a id="pg317"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg317]</span>
evolutionary history of the development of the various molluscan orders
through geological time does not seem to bear out the fact that an
"ideal" mollusk, as we shall construct him, ever actually existed,
or that his prototype, the <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>, was the first and consequently
the ancestral type of the phylum. We must therefore
only accept this ideal mollusk theoretically, to serve as a guide
for the time being. We may profitably use it only as a lay
figure—a sort of manikin, which will introduce us to the phylum.
After our introduction we must forget our imaginary type and
abandon any notion we may have conceived of the parental position
of the <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>, its closest imitator in actual life.</p>

<h5>THE IDEAL MOLLUSK</h5>

<p>The ideal mollusk has a compact, somewhat elongated body,
the under or ventral portion of which is thickened into a muscular
disk, upon which it creeps along. This disk is called the
<em class="e000I2">foot</em>. (Note a snail thus crawling upon his "foot.") The foot is
rounded or obtusely pointed posteriorly. Forward, the body is
slightly narrowed into a neck, and then expanded again into a
head. Upon this head are carried two projecting, mobile, fleshy
tentacles, one upon each side, that superficially resemble two
horns. At the base of each tentacle, upon the inner side, is an
eye. Just below and between the tentacles is a small horizontal
slit,—the mouth,—the lips being slightly thickened. The visceral
portion of the animal is above the foot, or <em class="e000I2">dorsal</em> to it, and extends
the whole length of the animal from the mouth to the
excretory opening, the latter being situated posteriorly. The
visceral cavity is inclosed above by a thin skin; indeed, it is but
the great thickening of this skin below that constitutes the foot.</p>

 </td></tr></table>

</div></div>

<p>The digestive tract, beginning at the mouth, opens immediately
into a muscular throat, which is called the <em class="e000I2">buccal mass</em>. Within
the buccal mass there is a long, fleshy ribbon that bears upon its
upper surface numerous rows of sharp teeth; these rows of teeth
run crossways on the ribbon, each row containing more or less
prominent median teeth, with several laterals upon each side, and
with marginal teeth on each side of the laterals. This is called
the <em class="e000I2">radula</em>, and is used for tearing or rasping the food. When
<a id="pg319"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg319]</span> not in use it lies coiled up within the buccal mass. Beyond the
buccal mass, food passes into the esophagus, which widens out
into a muscular pouch or stomach; this may also be provided
with chitinous teeth or hard knobs or plates for the purpose of
further triturating the food. Above and partially surrounding
the stomach is a large reddish or brownish liver, which furnishes
to the alimentary canal the digestive juices. From the stomach
the intestine leads to the terminal anal opening. There are two
organs, serving the function of kidneys, placed dorsally one upon
each side of the body (<em class="e000I2">nephridia</em>). A heart lies within the median
line of the body, and consists of a ventricle and two lateral auricles.
The vascular system is almost entirely closed; only in so far
as it is partially open does it essentially differ from that of higher
groups; the blood is whitish or light bluish, and receives its
oxygenation in the gills or along the free mantle surface, through
which it courses in exceedingly thin capillaries. In this manner
respiration is carried on to some extent throughout the whole
outer surface of the body. There are two <em class="e000I2">branchiæ</em> (gills). These
have the appearance of small feathers and are placed upon each
side of the animal posteriorly; they project slightly. Spread
over the top of this animal, fitting it perfectly, is a thin fleshy
covering attached to its dorsal portion like a skin, but hanging
free, like a flap, over the sides, the head, and the posterior end of
the animal. Upon the sides it may just cover the tips of the branchiæ,
but in front the head is seen to project from under it.
The loose-hanging portion of this sac-like covering is somewhat
thickened, and perhaps recurved upward upon itself. Upon the
edge of this flap all the way around may occur a row of cilia, or
tentacular processes. This cloak-like covering is called the mantle,
and, as already noted, is the most peculiar and persistent characteristic
of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>. The "cavity" formed between the loose-hanging
portion of the mantle and the sides of the foot is called
the <em class="e000I2">mantle cavity</em>, and contains posteriorly the gills, or branchiæ.
From the outer surface of this mantle a calcareous secretion takes
place, forming a shell, which, in our ideal mollusk, will be shaped
in conformity with the surface outlines of the mantle, oblong and
convex above. Over the lower portion of the shell the edge of <a id="pg320"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg320]</span>
the mantle recurves. When the creature is disturbed or is at
complete rest it may withdraw that portion of the mantle which
protrudes from below the shell entirely within the edge of the
shell, so that the "soft parts" may be wholly covered, and thus
protected from harm. In such a state of rest nothing may be
seen from above but a shell. The entire upper surface of the
mantle is firmly attached to the under or inner side of the shell,
except the mantle margin, this being free.</p>

<p>The nervous system consists of a circumesophageal ring of
nerve-cells, with two cords passing along the digestive tract to
the posterior end of the animal. In the head and above the
buccal mass are several series of nerve-ganglia. These also communicate
with the posterior portion of the animal through two
parallel cords which pass along its ventral side. From these
four principal branches, which traverse the entire length of the
creature, minor nerve-cords are thrown off to the tentacles, the
foot, the branchiæ, and the various organs of the viscera. The
sexes are separate.</p>

<p>Reviewing our "typical mollusk," we find that it is bilaterally
symmetrical—that is, uniform upon both sides of a median line
from mouth to excretory opening; is unsegmented; has the ventral
surface thickened into a creeping foot or disk; and is possessed
of a head with tentacular processes, a radula, lateral
branchiæ, a heart with a ventricle and two auricles, a well-developed
mantle, and a shell.</p>

<p>If the reader can learn these few details of organization he
knows the structure of a mollusk. In turning to the actual
living forms he will find merely modifications (though sometimes
confusing ones) of these various parts.</p>

<h4 title="Classification">CLASSIFICATION</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em> are divided into five great classes: <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, <em class="e000I2">Scaphopoda</em>, <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Cephalopoda</em>. These
names, it will be noticed, with the exception of the first, all refer
to the <em class="e000I2">foot</em>, the modifications of the foot being selected as the basis
of the first great divisions of the phylum. The <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> crawl
upon the thickened ventral surface of their bodies (already <a id="pg321"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg321]</span>
referred to as the foot), as the common garden-snail, the periwinkles,
and in general all those mollusks which have a spirally
coiled shell. The <em class="e000I2">Scaphopoda</em> have a long, worm-like foot, with
which they burrow in the sand or mud. Their shells are like
miniature elephant-tusks, but are open at both ends. The <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>
have a more or less club-shaped foot, utilized, in the many
families, for a great variety of purposes. They are always inclosed
in a bivalve shell. Familiar examples are the oysters,
the clams, mussels, etc. The <em class="e000I2">Cephalopoda</em> have the <em class="e000I2">foot</em> modified
into a number of <em class="e000I2">arms</em>, which encircle the head or the mouth.
They are the cuttlefishes, the octopi, squids, etc.</p>

<h4 title="Class Amphineura">CLASS <em class="eBU001">AMPHINEURA</em></h4>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">POLYPLACOPHORA</em></h5>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>, as already observed, approach most closely
to the ideal mollusk just described. They are bilaterally symmetrical.
This fact is so important that it constitutes them a
class, notwithstanding the fact that in respect to the foot (the
basis of division into classes) they would be included with the
<em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, for (barring some exceptional instances) they creep
along upon a foot quite as our ideal mollusk would, and as the
<em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> do. The head carries no tentacles, thus essentially
differing in this respect from the ideal form. The mantle is
extended down in front, completely covering the head. The
branchiæ are confined to a few pairs of <em class="e000I2">ctenidia</em>, or plume-like
gills, within the mantle groove or cavity, and are arranged upon
each side of the excretory opening like small feathers.</p>

<p>There are two orders of the <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Polyplacophora</em>
and the <em class="e000I2">Aplacophora</em> (or <em class="e000I2">Solenogastres</em>), the one name meaning
"bearing many plates," and the other "without plates,"
the word "plate" in this sense being synonymous with "shell."
The shell of the first order consists of eight calcareous disks
arranged in a longitudinal row along the back or dorsal side of
the animal, which overlap like shingles on a roof and admit of
great variation of form in the various families. <a id="pg322"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg322]</span></p>

<p>It will be observed from the examples given that the shell plates
do not entirely cover the mantle, but that a considerable portion
of the upper mantle surface is left exposed along the side of the
animal. This exposed portion of the
mantle is called the <em class="e000I2">girdle</em>. It is always
very much thickened and is often exceedingly
tough. In some species it is
covered by a great number of calcareous
spicules or granules which are embedded
in the leathery mantle tissue.
Strangely enough, the <em class="e000I2">Chitonidæ</em> (a large
family of the <em class="e000I2">Polyplacophora</em>) possess a
great number of eyes scattered over the
shell plates like minute dots.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 201px;">

 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Chiton spinosus</em>, dorsal view.</div>
</div>

<p>The members of this order are to be
found in all parts of the world, but
their greatest development is upon the
west coast of America. In California
the student of marine life has a splendid
opportunity to examine the chitons.
They are generally to be found adhering
to the under surface of stones about low-tide
mark. They are very sluggish in
their movements and may readily be removed
from their resting-places by suddenly
thrusting a knife-blade under the
foot and prying them off. When thus
detached they have a habit of rolling up
into a ball and so remaining indefinitely;
to prevent this they should be
placed at once in a jar of sea-water,
where they will resume their natural
position. For preservation as cabinet
specimens, chitons should be tied down
between two boards or flat substances, to hold them firmly extended
until dried; otherwise they are apt to contract out of
shape.</p>

</div>

<p>Six or eight species are exceedingly common upon the west <a id="pg323"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg323]</span>
coast. The collector who has successfully taken a number of
these will not fail to note the varying degrees of width of the
girdle in the different species. In some
cases the girdle partially covers the overlapping
shell plates. The largest of all
the chitons inhabits the California shores
and is known as <em class="eB00I2">Cryptochiton stelleri</em>.
It measures fully six inches in length and
three in width. In <em class="e000I2">Cryptochiton</em> the girdle
is continued over the shell plates as a tough, gritty, brownish
covering. The shell plates are white, and, as detached pieces, are
frequently to be found cast up upon the California beaches, where,
from their curious shape, they are often referred to as "butterfly-shells."</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 218px;">

<div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Chiton ruber.</em>
 <em class="e000I2">Chiton apiculatus.</em></div>
</div>

<p>On the east coast of America there are comparatively few
species, and these are all small and inconspicuous. The three
commonest ones are <em class="eB00I2">Chiton ruber</em>, <em class="eB00I2">C. albus</em>, and <em class="eB00I2">C. apiculatus</em>.
They may readily be found on stones or dead shells fished up
from below low-tide mark, or in rock-pools left by the receding
tide.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">APLACOPHORA</em></h5>

<p>This second order of the <em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em> is entirely destitute of
the shell plates characteristic of the first. The outer mantle surface,
however, develops a number of calcareous granules which
correspond to a shell. The <em class="e000I2">Aplacophora</em> are symmetrical, having
the mouth and the excretory opening at the anterior and posterior
ends respectively. The foot is greatly modified, being narrowed
at times to a mere slit along the ventral surface. Some of them
have long, worm-like bodies. This is no doubt a very primitive
form of mollusk, or, if not a primitive form, it has greatly degenerated
from some higher type. They are supposed to be commensal

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Aplacophora</em> are not littoral animals, and it is extremely
unlikely that one will ever encounter them upon the beach, unless,
possibly, after the severest of storms. We may therefore
leave them with this mere mention and proceed to the second
class of mollusks, the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>. <a id="pg324"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg324]</span></p>

<h4 title="Class Gasteropoda"><a id="pg328"></a>CLASS <em class="eBU001">GASTEROPODA</em></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The class <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> is the largest and most comprehensive
subdivision of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>, and within its wide range of
families many differing details of organization are to be found.
As a class it possesses all the most characteristic features of the
phylum, though it is frequently modified in a high degree. This
class includes all the univalve mollusks (except <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em> and
<em class="e000I2">Dentalia</em>), such as the snails, the whelks, and the host of spirally
coiled land, fresh-water, and marine shells.</p>

<p>The gasteropod foot is, as has been remarked, primarily the
same as in our schematic mollusk—a flat, muscular disk caused
by the thickening of the ventral body-surface. The neck, head,
and tentacles are also quite the same, but considerable modification
of these organs will be found when we come to examine
some specimens. The mantle is always present, except in the
nudibranch or non-shell-bearing forms; but in few of the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>
is the mantle so regularly simple as in our ideal mollusk.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most striking feature of the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, and one
that will at first surprise him who has in mind the simple structure
of the ideal mollusk, is the fact that they are always asymmetrical—that
is to say, a median line drawn longitudinally
through a gasteropod will not divide it into halves of similar
anatomical structure.</p>

<p>The quality of symmetry is an important one throughout the
lower orders of animal life. In nearly all phyletic or class descriptions
the word "symmetry" occurs, and its exact meaning
must be understood. Take, for example, a human being; a median
line drawn vertically would divide him into two similar halves—upon
each side would be an eye, an arm, a leg, etc., of similar
shape and construction. So far at least as the external features <a id="pg329"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg329]</span>
go, man is then a symmetrical creature; likewise the vertebrates
in general. Cases of actual symmetry are found in the lobsters
and crabs and in the segmented worms. It is usual in describing
mollusks broadly and in general terms to call them symmetrical
animals, yet here is the largest class within the phylum, whose
representatives are none of them symmetrical. In the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>
the mouth is anteriorly placed in the head, just as in the ideal
form, but the digestive tract, after traversing the visceral cavity
in the usual fashion, suddenly turns forward and terminates
in an excretory opening either on the right or on the left
side of the animal, just back of the head. The various other orifices
for the genital and renal glands are also placed in this
unexpected anterior position. The gills, or branchiæ, are to be
found upon one side only, forward of the heart, and differ
somewhat in appearance from the plume-like processes of the
<em class="e000I2">Amphineura</em>.</p>

<p>What, then, has become of the corresponding gill we should expect
to find on the other side? The symmetrical shape of the
foot is not in the least altered, but what has happened to cause
this distortion of the visceral portion of the animal? And,
finally, will this torsion of the body of the snail perhaps account
for the spiral nature of the shell?</p>

<p>An evolutionary process is supposed to have taken place in
mollusks, which, if real, would no doubt account for these curious
conditions of torsion in the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>; but the theory upon
which this process is based is altogether speculative, and is not
fully sustained by the facts in the case. Originally all mollusks
are presumed to have been symmetrical, and are assumed to have
resembled very much in form the schematic creature we have
already described. Now, for some reason, certain of the primitive
mollusks, but not all of them, began to develop a larger visceral
mass, which, continuing to enlarge throughout many generations,
began finally to protrude above and form a hump on the dorsal
side of the animal. This hump, containing the liver, a portion of
the intestines, and the generative glands, as it increased in bulk
became so much elevated that it could no longer maintain itself
in an erect position over the body, but, impelled by its own <a id="pg330"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg330]</span>
weight, began to sag over to one side. Such a process would of
course tend to twist the digestive tract and bring the excretory
opening constantly farther forward on one side. At the same
time, this process would necessarily interfere, by the weight of
the overhanging viscera and the shell covering the mass, with the
development of the branchiæ lying upon that side and now crowded
under the visceral mass. Thus, according to this theory, this
process has continued until, in the modern gasteropod, the digestive
tract has been bent upon itself and twisted from a straight
course into a curve of almost 180°, bringing the excretory
opening near or just over the head, where it empties into the
mantle cavity; while the original right gill, by the same movement,
has been brought to a position on the <em class="e000I2">left</em> side of the
head, forward of the heart, the original left gill having been
crowded out, eventually to atrophy and disappear. The same
torsion is found in the nerve-cords; the heart, situated at about
the pivotal position of this twisting process, has turned about
upon itself, leaving an auricle in front of the ventricle, one
auricle, like one of the gills, having been lost. The mantle portion
covering the visceral hump naturally continued to secrete its
shell, though always in conformity with the change, the result
being the familiar spiral form of the usual gasteropod shell.</p>

<p>This theory may not be satisfactory, but the asymmetry of
gasteropods is a problem to be solved, and a more interesting
line of biological investigation could not be found.</p>

<p>Let us now take a good example of a gasteropod and locate its
various organs; at the same time we may use the occasion to
refer to more important modifications of these organs which will
be encountered later in the various genera. The most available
gasteropod on the east coast of the United States for this
purpose, is <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>, both on account of its large size and its
abundance. <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> may be used if the student is north of
Cape Cod and therefore unable to secure a good living specimen
of <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>; the anatomical differences between the two are slight.</p>

<p>Note the siphon protruding forward from a notch in the shell.
This consists merely in an elongation of a fold of the mantle,
which is held in a manner to constitute a tube, through which <a id="pg331"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg331]</span>
the animal draws in water to supply the gills, lying just back
of the siphon and concealed under the mantle in the cavity
already spoken of as the mantle cavity. With the exception of
that portion of the mantle which constitutes the siphon, no part
of its margin, it will be observed, can be seen, the edge of the
shell completely hiding it from view.</p>

<p>In some genera the siphon is exceedingly long—in fact, longer
than the body of the animal. In these cases the mollusk is
generally fond of burying
itself in the sand and maintaining
communication with
the world above only by
means of this long, fleshy
tube. In some genera the
siphon is protected by an
elongation of the shell, as in
<em class="e000I2">Fasciolaria</em> (<a href="#Plate-LXXVI">Plate LXXVI.</a>).
An extreme example of this is given in the figure on <a href="#pg343">page 343</a>,
which represents a species of <em class="e000I2">Murex</em>, where the siphon is not only
protected by the shell, but the shell itself is further protected by
the double row of sharp spines with which it is beset.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 299px;">
 <a id="fig-Buccinum-undatum"></a>
 <img src="images/i423.jpg" width="299" height="165" alt="" />
 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Buccinum undatum</em>:
 <em class="e000I2">si</em>, siphon.</div>
</div>

<p>There are some genera which possess no siphons at all, in all
of which cases there is no notch in the shell opening, the aperture
being round, as in <em class="e000I2">Natica</em> and in <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em>
(<a href="#pg368">pages 368</a>, <a href="#pg371">371</a>). The
mollusks of this type make a fold in the forward part of the
mantle which serves as a siphon. Such a muscular folding in
the mantle would be technically called a <em class="e000I2">functional siphon</em>.</p>

<p>On the posterior dorsal side of the foot is attached a horny
plate, of concentric structure about a central or subcentral
point or nucleus. This is called the <em class="e000I2">operculum</em>, and serves
to close the entrance of the shell when the animal is withdrawn,
the object no doubt being protective. The opercula vary to a
great extent in the different genera; in some cases they are calcareous,
in others cartilaginous. When the aperture of the shell
is very large it often happens that the operculum does not entirely
close the opening, as in <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>, but in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> it is a close fit.
The operculum is entirely wanting in the <em class="e000I2">Pulmonata</em>, one of the <a id="pg332"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg332]</span>
large orders of the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>. The figures represent some of
the commoner types of opercula.</p>

<h5>TENTACLES</h5>

<p>Two tentacles project like fleshy horns from the sides of
the head. These are not retractile, as in the land-snails, and
their office appears to be that of sensory organs. In both <em
class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> and <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>
the tentacles are comparatively short and stout, and have
expanded bases; in many other genera they are long and slender.
Almost without exception the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>
possess tentacles. <a id="pg333"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg333]</span></p>

<h5>EYES</h5>

<p>In <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> the eyes are situated near the bases and upon the
outer sides of the tentacles; in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> they are extremely small
and are mounted about midway between the bases and the tips of
the tentacles. This is the usual position for the eyes in the
marine <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>. Only in the pulmonates, or land-snails, are
the eyes placed at the summit of the tentacles. Sight does not
appear to be a very important sense in the gasteropods, although
the eye in some instances becomes a highly developed organ. A
number of forms that have the habit of burrowing deep into the
sand or mud are quite destitute of visual organs, and certain
cave-dwelling land-shells have entirely lost the sense of vision.</p>

<h5>MOUTH AND PROBOSCIS</h5>

<p>The mouth will easily be seen in both <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> and <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>.
It is a small slit with slightly thickened, fleshy lips, and is placed
on the lower forward portion of the head. In the case of both
of these genera the mouth is situated at the end of a proboscis.
It will be noted that <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> has a comparatively long and stout
proboscis, or snout, which is not retractile. <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> has a smaller
one. It is fairly safe to assume that all gasteropods that possess
a proboscis are carnivorous. This organ is greatly developed in
some genera, where it actually exceeds in length the rest of the
animal. In such instances, no doubt, the creature is enabled to
reach the interior portions of the shells of its victims and to
devour every vestige of their flesh, for the mouth is most conveniently
placed just at the end of this long, trunk-like organ.
The genera which have no proboscis are, almost without exception,
vegetable feeders.</p>

<p>We must now remove the animal from its shell. It is well to
boil it first, for this does away with the annoying mucous secretion
that is freely exuded by glands in the foot when the creature
is roughly handled. Alcoholic specimens are apt to be much
contracted and hardened, and are therefore less satisfactory as
subjects for anatomical study. If it is not convenient to boil the <a id="pg334"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg334]</span>
specimen, break away the shell with a hammer, using care not to
lacerate the soft, fleshy portion within; when this is accomplished,
wash the animal carefully to remove the slimy exudation. Note
the "visceral hump," which is spiral, and which formerly occupied
the upper-whorl portion of the shell. The thin skin covering
it is the mantle, which below is greatly thickened and free, lying
about the foot like a heavy fleshy flap.</p>

<h5>MANTLE</h5>

<p>The mantle-edge in both of these examples is simple; that is to
say, it possesses no fringe of tentacles, nor is it supplemented by
extra processes, characters which mark many genera of marine
<em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>. In <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> and <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> the mantle-edge does not
protrude below the edge of the shell; but in many genera, especially
those which possess smooth, glossy shells, like the cowries (<em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em>)
and the graceful <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>, the mantle is proportionately very much
larger. In these two genera, when the animal is extended, as in
crawling about the sand, the mantle curves upward and incloses a
large portion of the shell itself. Indeed, in some genera the shell
is almost entirely concealed by this extension of the mantle (<em class="e000I2">Sigaretus</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Natica</em>, etc.).</p>

<p>When the shell is removed, the folding of the mantle which
constitutes the siphon can be plainly seen. The office of the siphon
has already been referred to, also the fact that the presence of a
siphon in the gasteropod mollusk may always be determined by
merely glancing at the shell alone, for a notch at the base of the
aperture indicates the place through which the siphon passed.
In <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> this is merely a notch, but in <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> the siphonal
canal of the shell is much longer. Just why the long siphons of
some mollusks should be naked and exposed to danger, while
others are so carefully protected by elongated, portions of the
shell, is a mystery, but nature is full of such contradictions.</p>

<h5>THE GASTEROPOD FOOT</h5>

<p>The foot is long, broad, and flat on the under side, like a
disk. The variations in the gasteropod foot are almost infinite.
<a id="pg335"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg335]</span> In some
of the species it is amazingly large and powerful, as in <em
class="e000I2">Polynices</em> (<em class="e000I2">Natica</em>),
and in most of the forms which live along sandy beaches. These are
sometimes provided in front with a wedge-shaped process called the
<em class="e000I2">propodium</em>, which serves admirably as a plow
to push aside the heavy wet sand through which the animal forces
its way. In <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>, which is so common all
along our coasts, the foot has two terminal appendages or points
behind.</p>

</div>

<p>There is no single feature of mollusks more important than the
foot, for upon the many modifications of this organ the various
molluscan classes are founded. The name <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> means
"stomach-foot," the latter organ being merely a thickening of <a id="pg336"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg336]</span>
the ventral surface of the animal, giving to the creature, when
active, the appearance of crawling upon its stomach.</p>

<p>If a living gasteropod is placed in a jar of sea-water and left
undisturbed it will soon crawl up the side of the glass and thus
afford an excellent view of the extended under surface of its foot.
The majority of the gasteropods are lethargic and slow in movement,
but others will be found to be exceedingly lively and able
to creep up the sides of the jar and make their escape in a surprisingly
short time. Further modifications of the foot will be
mentioned later.</p>

<h5>THE MANTLE CAVITY</h5>

<p>Now let us place the animal with the foot below and the head
facing us. The spiral visceral hump will point back and away
from the observer. The mantle covering the visceral portion
is thin and translucent like an ordinary skin, but at the base
of the visceral mass the mantle suddenly thickens very greatly,
and spreads over the dorsal portion of the foot or the body like a
cloak. The space between the body and the loose-lying mantle
is called the <em class="e000I2">mantle cavity</em>, and within this area are to be found
several important external organs. To find these it is well to cut
the mantle flap in a straight line, beginning just back of the head
and ending at the point where the mantle is attached to the body.
This will most easily be done with scissors. Having thus divided
the mantle in front, throw back the two flaps. On the right-hand
side (left of the animal), and attached to the inner side of the
mantle thus exposed, will be seen the branchiæ, or gills.</p>

<h5>THE BRANCHIÆ, OR GILLS</h5>

<p>They consist of a row of flattened filaments bound together at
the base like the leaves of a book. The blood is conveyed to
these gills by a large vein, and is then forced through the thinly
walled filaments, being thus brought into close contact with the
water, to which it releases its carbon dioxide, and from which
it receives the life-giving oxygen. In certain gasteropods there
are two sets of gills, one placed upon each side of the body
<a id="pg338"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg338]</span> (as in the ideal mollusk); but the presence of two sets of
gills only indicates, in these gasteropods, that the twisting process
of the viscera, already alluded to as so remarkable a feature of
this class, has not proceeded far enough to destroy the functional
activity of one of the gills.</p>

</div>
<p>In general, it may be said that the breathing process of mollusks
does not markedly differ from the respiratory methods of
higher forms of animals. Whether the breathing is effected by
gills or by a pulmonary sac, the essential features of the system
are the same as in fishes or mammals. There are, however, some
rather peculiar developments in the breathing system of gasteropods
that are worthy of notice. The gills themselves differ
throughout the various orders of this class both as to their structure
and their relative position; in one of the orders (the <em class="e000I2">Pulmonata</em>)
the gills have entirely disappeared, and are replaced by
a pulmonary sac which fulfils the purpose of a lung.</p>

<p>It is a generally accepted theory that all land or air-breathing
mollusks were originally marine, but by a gradual change in their
habits have developed into terrestrial forms, losing their gills and
acquiring in their place organs which correspond to lungs. The
theory is supported by the fact that many species of marine
mollusks live between tide-marks, and for several hours daily are
obliged to maintain life outside of their native element. The
<em class="e000I2">Littorinidæ</em>, which may always be found in abundance on both the
east and the west American coasts, usually live high above low-tide
line, and some tropical species of this genus actually live in
the trees above the reach of high tide. They have gills just as
in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> or <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>, but the <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em> shell is strongly suggestive
of certain land forms, and there is reason to believe that the genus
is in course of evolution into a pulmonate. On the other hand,
there are to be found in fresh water numerous genera which are
true pulmonates, and which are obliged to come to the surface
every few minutes to obtain air. One notable genus of marine
gasteropods possesses both lungs and gills, and one marine
form has entirely lost its gills and breathes only by means of
lungs. It is quite likely that all mollusks are able to breathe
more or less all along the exposed mantle surface, which is usually <a id="pg339"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg339]</span>
crowded with capillaries with exceedingly thin walls. This very
remarkable method of surface respiration is proved to exist in
the nudibranch or shell-less marine <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, for they possess
neither gills nor lungs.</p>

<h5>OSPHRADIUM</h5>

<p>Lying just under the gills, and side by side with them, is a
smaller, plume-like organ having the appearance of a smaller gill;
it is called the <em class="e000I2">osphradium</em>. The office of this organ is not definitely
known, but the supposition is that it is the seat of the
olfactory nerves. The osphradia are not always present, but whenever
found they are placed in close conjunction with the gills, in
order, probably, that the animal may best determine the quality
of the water brought by the siphon to the breathing-organs. In
<em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> the osphradium is especially prominent. In all mollusks
the sense of smell is highly developed. A dead animal
anchored to the bottom will very soon attract the carnivorous
<em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em> from every direction. This is not a bad way to trap
certain species that live upon rocky stations and are otherwise
difficult to secure by the dredge.</p>

<p>On the left-hand side (right of the animal), and adhering to
the under side of the mantle flap, which has been thrown back, a
somewhat inflated and convoluted tube, the rectum, will be seen.
It terminates in an opening just within the mantle-edge. By
the side of this are the renal and genital openings.</p>

<p><br />Having now examined the external organs, we may investigate
the internal anatomy of our subject. To do this thoroughly requires
considerable skill, but for the purpose of merely discovering
the relative positions of the principal internal organs a little
care only is necessary. The work will be greatly facilitated by
boiling the animal for a few minutes, for this serves to harden
the tissues and to separate the various organs in a most satisfactory
manner.</p>

<p>To begin, open the proboscis from the mouth, cutting back so
as to expose the esophagus. It will be seen that the throat is
long and very muscular. <a id="pg340"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg340]</span></p>

 <div class="caption">Portion of the radula of<br /> <em
 class="e000I2">Imbricaria marmorata</em>.</div>
</div>

<p>The radula has been the subject of much study by conchologists,
and has furnished the basis for an arrangement of the numerous
sections of gasteropods into somewhat well-defined groups. If the
observer has a strong glass he will notice that each transverse
row of teeth on the ribbon consists of a median or central tooth
with several points or "cusps." <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> has
a median tooth with three cusps; <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em>
one with six. On each side of the median tooth is a lateral
tooth, which in <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> will be seen to
have six cusps, and in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> five. In
many patterns of radulæ there is, besides the median and lateral
teeth, still another paired row, called the marginals. In the
accompanying figures are given some examples which show small
sections of lingual ribbons. While all the radulæ of mollusks are
capable of being grouped by their general characteristics, yet in
no two species of mollusks are the radulæ quite identical. <a

<h5>VITAL ORGANS, STOMACH, LIVER, RENAL GLANDS, ETC.</h5>

<p>The digestive tract will be found to widen out a short distance
back into a crop or stomach, and, continuing still further, to lose
itself in a soft, brownish mass within the coiled spire, which is the
liver. The very large size of the liver leads one to suspect that
<em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> and <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> must be voracious creatures to need so large
an organ for the secretion of bile. In many species of mollusks
the stomach and intestines are filled quite solidly, at times, with a
gelatinous transparent substance called the <em class="e000I2">crystalline stylet</em>. Just
why the digestive tract should be clogged with this substance no
one has yet been able to explain, so here again is a chance for
original investigation. The intestine curves about after reaching
the liver, and comes forward again to appear once more as the
rectum, clinging to the inner surface of the free portion of the
mantle.</p>

<p>Closely associated with the liver, but differing slightly in color,
is the gonad, or organ in which the genital products are formed.
Situated dorsally and forward of the liver and gonad is a large
renal gland, which may readily be detected by its peculiar structure.
In some forms the kidney is closely associated with the
gonad, and seems to coöperate with the latter in the generative
functions.</p>

<h5>HEART AND VASCULAR SYSTEM</h5>

<p>To find the heart, make an incision into the body just at the
posterior end of the gills. The heart is white and round, and is
inclosed within a cavity known as the <em class="e000I2">pericardium</em>; it has a ventricle
and one or two auricles, although in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> and <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em>
there is but one auricle.</p>

<p>There is nothing remarkable about the vascular system to distinguish
it from that of many higher forms of animals. It is,
however, not completely closed—by which is meant that the blood
is not always contained within arteries or veins, and that it does
sometimes flow into other organs and floods certain other body-cavities,
although the vascular system of mollusks is by no
means so completely open as is that of insects and crustaceans. <a id="pg342"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg342]</span></p>

<p>Having examined the animal which inhabits the shell and
gained an idea of its anatomy, we may now turn to an inspection
of the house which it has built for itself, and here we shall find a
delightful subject for study.</p>

<h5>THE GASTEROPOD SHELL</h5>

</div>

<p>An industrious hour of collecting upon almost any beach will
provide the student with an abundance of interesting shells.
Putting aside the bivalves, the univalve or gasteropod shells
remaining should be closely examined for the purpose of becoming
acquainted with their various conchological features. The collector
will see at once that he has a number of species that differ more
or less widely in their general form, size, texture, and sculpture.
Some shells will be long in proportion to their width, with many
turns of the spire which probably terminates in a sharply pointed
apex; others will be almost round, with comparatively few spiral
turns which end in a blunt apex, giving to the specimen outlines
suggestive of a dome. A wide range of characters will be found
in the mouths or apertures of the shells, some being almost if
not quite round, others oblong and with a notch cut into the
lower portion of the opening, and others possibly with this notch
extended into a sort of semi-inclosed channel. A first lesson
in classification of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em> may
be taken by dividing the results of the first day's collecting
of univalve shells into groups according to these prominent
shell-characters.</p>

<p>A good knowledge of the parts of a gasteropod shell is essential
to the student, and it can readily be acquired. Four specimens
are given in the accompanying figures, representing highly
divergent <a id="pg343"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg343]</span>
types of marine gasteropods, and their respective characteristics
may be noted by comparing them one with another: <em
class="e000I2">Fasciolaria tulipa</em> (<a href="#Plate-LXXVI">Plate LXXVI.</a>), a Floridian
shell; <em class="e000I2">Polynices heros</em>, a common species
found on all the sandy shores of the American Atlantic coast;
<em class="e000I2">Murex tenuispina</em>, an Indo-Pacific
species much prized by collectors; and <em class="e000I2">Acmæa
testudinalis</em>, commonly found in Maine and Massachusetts at low
tide clinging to rocks.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 566px;">
 <a id="fig-Polynices-Acmaea-Murex"></a>

</ul></div>
</div>

<p>The extreme top of the shell is called the <em class="e000I2">apex</em>, and it may be
either sharply pointed or obtuse. Each turn is called a <em class="e000I2">whorl</em>;
the last one, and always the largest, is called the <em class="e000I2">body-whorl</em>, the
others collectively forming the <em class="e000I2">spire</em> of the shell. When the animal
first emerges from the egg it is always provided with one or
two whorls, which generally may be distinguished at the apex as
smoother than the rest of the spire, and a faint line may be
discovered where the shell began its growth after birth. These <a id="pg344"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg344]</span>
first whorls of embryonic growth are usually referred to as the
<em class="e000I2">nepionic whorls</em>. The interstices between the successive whorls
are called <em class="e000I2">sutures</em>, and these lines of juncture may be shallow or
deep according to the convexity of the whorls. The sculpturing
of the whorls is often of great complexity, and exhibits <em class="e000I2">nodules</em>,
<em class="e000I2">varices</em>, <em class="e000I2">ribs</em>, <em class="e000I2">revolving striæ</em>, <em class="e000I2">spinous processes</em>, and <em class="e000I2">lines of growth</em>. It
frequently happens that there is a complete absence of any sculpturing
whatever, the whole surface of the shell being perfectly
smooth, save for the faint lines of growth to be detected only
under a magnifying-glass. The outer edge of the mouth or
aperture of the shell is called the <em class="e000I2">outer lip</em>. This may be more or
less thickened, expanded, or simple. The inner lip is called the
<em class="e000I2">columella</em>, and may be greatly extended anteriorly. When the
mouth of the shell is round, and there is no notch or indentation
either above or below, it is said to be <em class="e000I2">continuous</em>.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">anterior canal</em> is for the accommodation of the siphon of
the animal, which, as noted above, may be very long or almost
entirely absent; therefore the character of the shell generally
indicates whether or not the animal itself possesses a long siphon.
There is in some forms a notch at the upper extremity of the
mouth, which is for the accommodation of the anal discharges.
When present it is called the <em class="e000I2">posterior canal</em>.</p>

<p>It will be noted that all the specimens figured as examples,
save one, are spiral, the coils revolving about an imaginary axis.
When the whorls are not too closely coiled there is left open to
the view a hollow space throughout the entire length of the shell,
which is called the <em class="e000I2">umbilicus</em>. When the coils of the shell are
very compact there is no umbilicus to be seen. The umbilical
opening may be very large, giving a clear view of the inner surfaces
of all the whorls right through to the apex. The usual
gasteropod shell is in reality a hollow tube wound about an
imaginary axis. Since the tube increases in size as it progresses,
the base of the shell is necessarily wider and larger than the apex.
Thus all gasteropod shells may be reduced in shape to the single
type of a cone or top, modified by the excessive length or shortness
of the spire, or otherwise altered by special peculiarities. In
<em class="e000I2">Polynices duplicata</em> (<a href="#pg368">page 368</a>), it will be observed that while the <a id="pg345"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg345]</span>
umbilicus is fairly large, its external opening, in the adult shell,
has been almost completely closed by a callous process thrown off
from the inner or columellar lip.</p>

<p>Gasteropod shells may be <em class="e000I2">sinistral</em> or <em class="e000I2">dextral</em>, according as the
whorls turn to the left or right. The great majority of marine
species are dextral, having the opening on the right, although a
few species exhibit the curious property of being constructed upon
either the one or the other plan without apparent reason. Sinistral
specimens of many normally dextral species have been discovered,
but they are so rare as to warrant the belief that such specimens
are merely deformities or monstrosities resulting from some accident
of birth.</p>

<p>The collector will soon learn to distinguish between young and
adult specimens, for those finishing touches of wonder and beauty
which the mollusk gives to his protective covering are made only
by the adult. The outer lip of young gasteropod shells is usually
thin and fragile; even if slightly thickened, it has an unformed
or unfinished appearance.</p>

<p>Shells differ greatly in their <em class="e000I2">structure</em>, many species being porcelanous
like china, others glassy, and many more are of a
softer chalky composition. In the latter case the shell is usually
covered with a thick membranous skin, which, when removed,
leaves a dull, lusterless, white body beneath. Shells of this texture,
when cast upon the beach, soon yield to the weathering
action of sun and air. The porcelanous shells are composed of
successive layers of carbonate of lime, throughout which is a
filmy membranous framework of a substance similar to that of
which the covering of the <em class="e000I2">Crustacea</em> is formed. The mode of
deposition of the various layers of crystalline calcic carbonate
and the peculiar lineation of their outer surfaces give rise to the
iridescent or nacreous appearance of some shells.</p>

<p>With the exception of those species in which the mantle of the
animal is extended over the edge of the aperture and more or
less envelops the entire test, there is an outer skin of membranous
or organic matter which overlies the surface of the shell.
This skin is sometimes quite thick, often hairy, and is usually of
a dull greenish-&#160;or brownish-yellow color. In many genera this <a id="pg346"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg346]</span>
outer covering of the shell is excessively thin. In old specimens
the epidermis is usually worn away from the apical whorls.
It often happens that the shells of the most exquisite colors and
markings are thus rendered somber and unattractive by their
tenants during life; when the animal dies, or when such specimens
are kept in a cabinet for a period of time, the epidermis
dries, cracks, and falls off, revealing the wealth of color and
design beneath.</p>

<p>The growth of the gasteropod shell is accomplished by the
exudation from the margin of the animal's mantle of a liquid
containing the shelly matter in solution. The mantle-edge is
provided with a complicated system of glands and pores, from
which is secreted this "stony liquor." This more or less viscous
liquid, containing the carbonate of lime and the other inorganic
materials of which the shell is composed, hardens upon exposure,
and the shelly matter is then deposited in crystalline form around
the edges or lip of the shell aperture. The gasteropod shell
therefore grows by the continual building out of its aperture
through successive depositions of shelly matter at the extreme
edge of the lip. At the extreme edge of the mantle margin are
situated those glands which secrete the materials for the epidermis
of the shell, and as one would therefore expect, this outermost
layer of epidermis is first produced in the advancing growth
of the shell. There also are situated the pigment-glands, which
produce the color-secretions. The various layers of the shelly
substance are successively deposited inside the mouth of the shell
by glands situated just back of the extreme edge of the mantle
margin. Thus in the growth stage, if one could examine closely
the aperture of a gasteropod shell, one would observe at the extreme
tip of the lip this projecting epidermis, just beneath it and
just inside the aperture a thin deposit of shelly matter, just beneath
this, and farther in, another layer, and still farther in a
third layer.</p>

<p>The growth of nearly all gasteropod shells is marked by periods
of rest. During the inactive seasons the creature may thicken
the edge of the aperture to a greater or less extent by an extra
deposit of shelly matter, for otherwise the thin lip might soon be <a id="pg347"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg347]</span>
injured or broken. These places where the lip was thickened,
as a temporary protection until the young animal decided to
continue building, appear on the surface of adult shells, and
persist as <em class="e000I2">varices</em>, "raised lines of growth," "longitudinal ribs,"
etc. Such forms of sculptural markings generally occur at equidistant
points and preserve a scheme of regularity which would
indicate that the periods of rest were of seasonal occurrence. All
irregularities and all surface features of the external shell simply
reflect certain peculiarities of the mantle margin of the animal;
all spinous processes, for instance, as in the marvelous <em class="e000I2">Murex
tenuispina</em>, indicate the existence of finger-like processes extending
from the mantle margin, which once occupied the hollow
thorns projecting from the shell. When the outer surface of a
shell is devoid of any sculpturing and is perfectly smooth, one
may assume that the mantle margin of the animal was simple. If
the edge of the lip has a crenulated appearance and the surface of
the whorls is decorated with revolving ribs, the mantle margin
was probably folded or wavy. There can be no doubt but that the
entire mantle surface is provided to some extent with glands for
the secretion of shelly matter, for if any portion of the shell is
accidentally injured the animal soon repairs the break with a calcareous
deposit. But such repairs are never homogeneous in
texture with the other parts of the shell of normal growth; the
patches are never covered externally with an epidermis, and they
are always devoid of color. The function of the epidermis is to
protect the calcareous shell from the corroding agents contained
in sea-water. Hence it is that, when the epidermis is removed,
"dead shells" exposed to the influence of the water or the weather
soon lose their brilliancy and luster, and become undesirable for
specimens either for the cabinet or for study. It often happens
that living shells, inhabiting a region where, for one cause or
another, the water is highly charged with impurities of an acid
nature, are discovered to be badly corroded about the apex, where
the epidermis is thin and likely to be rubbed off. For this reason
specimens collected in harbors near large cities or near the mouths
of rivers are apt to be poor and defective.</p>

<p>The inner surface of all shells, if not actually nacreous, is <a id="pg348"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg348]</span>
always perfectly smooth. When foreign substances, such as
grains of sand, enter the shell and cannot be removed by the
animal, the irritation caused thereby to the soft, fleshy creature
induces discharges of a liquid from the glandular surface of the
mantle, which hardens about the offending substance and glazes
it over with a smooth, pearly deposit.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Acmæa testudinalis</em> (<a href="#pg343">page 343</a>) presents a special type of gasteropod
shell which is found in several families. Here the spire
seems to be wholly absent, and the entire shell consists of but one
large body-whorl. There are very many of these patelliform
species, inhabiting many seas and belonging to many different
genera, and in nearly all cases their embryonic shells display a
spiral form. After birth the animal does not build his house
upon the spiral plan, but expands the shell into one large shield-like
covering. The student, however, must not presume that
<em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em> is an ancestral type just because the simple character of
the shell is suggestive of the model chosen to represent a schematic
mollusk; anatomically <em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em> presents the complications of body-torsion
which show a very considerable evolutionary change,
and indicate that its simple shell is probably a degenerate form of a
once more highly developed and convoluted one.</p>

<p>The forms, the architecture, and the painting of gasteropod
shells are so infinite in variety that it would be unwise to attempt
a description of their marvels. A close observer of nature's
works soon becomes prepared for every surprise, but he never
ceases to be charmed and fascinated by his new discoveries. The
careful student alone can learn really to see and appreciate the
wonders of nature, and this is especially true in the study of the
<em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>.</p>

<h5>CLASSIFICATION OF GASTEROPODS</h5>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> far exceed all the other divisions of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>
in the number of their genera and species. Apparently
this has not always been the case. There is evidence tending to
show that in past geological epochs the pelecypods (the bivalve
shells) outnumbered the gasteropods, but that in the course of
time the increase in the genera of gasteropods has been more <a id="pg349"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg349]</span>
rapid. To judge also from the very large number of extinct families
among the cephalopods, which once flourished in astonishing
abundance, it would appear that they are a dying race.</p>

<p>The classification of the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> is primarily a division
into three great orders: the <em class="e000I2">Opisthobranchiata</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Prosobranchiata</em>,
and the <em class="e000I2">Pulmonata</em>. The <em class="e000I2">Pulmonata</em>, which include the
land and fresh-water gasteropod shells, are characterized by the
presence of a breathing-sac, or lung, instead of gills. They are,
therefore, essentially air-breathers, and would perish if kept too
long under water. The <em class="e000I2">Opisthobranchiata</em> and <em class="e000I2">Prosobranchiata</em>
are marine, and, like all animals which breathe by means of gills,
soon die when removed from the water. We have already noted,
however, how some genera of marine gasteropods that find their
station about high-tide mark are able to live for considerable
periods out of the water, notwithstanding the fact that they are
fully equipped with gills and not possessed of lungs. Indeed,
there is one large family of prosobranchs (the <em class="e000I2">Cyclostomatidæ</em>)
that has become entirely terrestrial in habit, its members having
lost their gills and acquired lungs, but their organization otherwise
is so essentially that of the prosobranchs that they have
never been considered as pulmonates.</p>

<p>The main difference between these two orders of marine gasteropods
is that in the prosobranchs the breathing-organs (the
gills) are placed in a position forward of the heart, and the degree
of torsion (<a href="#pg330">page 330</a>) characteristic of this molluscan class has
been continued until the auricle of the heart is in front of the
ventricle. There is always a shell, usually spiral, and, with few
exceptions, an operculum. In the opisthobranchs, on the other
hand, the relative position of the heart and gills is reversed, and
they further differ from the prosobranchs in that the sexes are
always united in each individual. The opisthobranchs are not always
provided with a shell. One division of the order, known as
the "nudibranchs," are entirely naked. These are commonly called
the "sea-slugs," and are to be found crawling about the marine
vegetation in shallow water, in tide-pools, and on the piling of old
docks. Curiously enough, the sea-slugs (see <a href="#pg354">page 354</a>) have no gills
at all, but, having lost these apparently essential organs, are <a id="pg350"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg350]</span>
enabled to "breathe water" through their skin. They are wonderfully
beautiful creatures, and the collector must not fail to secure
some specimens, put them into a jar of sea-water, and watch
them expand.</p>

<p>There are other more superficial differences between the prosobranchs
and the opisthobranchs, which will enable even a beginner
to distinguish them at a glance. When the latter are possessed
of an external shell, it is bulbous, generally glassy, and with a
simple lip, the aperture extending the entire length of the shell.
Again, the mantle or the propodium of the foot is greatly extended
and usually covers the shell almost wholly.</p>

<p>With the exception of the nudibranchs, which are common all
along the Atlantic shore, especially north of Cape Cod, there are
very few opisthobranchs to be found in American waters. Their
shells are not very abundantly found anywhere, though in Florida
there are two or three species which an untrained collector might
discover.</p>

<p>Practically all the gasteropod or univalve shells that will be
taken by the ordinarily expert collector along the shore are prosobranchs.
This order includes the great majority of marine gasteropods,
and is entitled to the distinction of claiming, in the great
number of its genera and species, the most startling eccentricities
of form and color to be found among the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>, if not among
all marine invertebrates.</p>

<p>Only those species which are actually abundant on the Atlantic
and Pacific shores of the United States, and which are likely to be
found by the untrained collector, are selected from the long list
of forms which belong to the three faunal regions involved.</p>

 As has already been remarked, shell-bearing opisthobranchs are
not abundantly represented in number of species in North American
waters. South of Cape Cod, in muddy bays and well-sheltered places,
the little shell, <em class="e000I2">Haminea solitaria</em>, may,
however, often be found in considerable numbers.</p>

shining bluish-white, sometimes brownish in color, and is
marked with revolving grooves, which, being cut across by
irregular growth-lines, give its surface a faintly decussated
appearance. The aperture is as long as the shell; the columella
is incurved. This little species is especially abundant
in shallow water about Vineyard Sound and in Peconic Bay.</p></div>

a color-pattern of mottled or clouded reddish-brown on a white foundation.
There is no spire; there is a pit in place of an apex; and the
aperture extends the full length of the shell. To the naked eye the surface
appears smooth and shining. It is an exceedingly variable species,
occurring all through the West Indies, but not north of Florida. The
shores of the keys along the west coast of Florida are often strewn with
these shells after storms. The animal, like all the shell-bearing opisthobranchs,
is very large as compared with the shell, and the large mantle
folds recurve upward, almost completely hiding the shell from view.

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. nebulosa.</em> This is one of the largest and finest species of the
family <em class="e000I2">Bullidæ</em>. It is found on the coast of California south of San
Francisco. The shell is much larger than that of either of the Atlantic
species mentioned above, but very closely resembles them in outline,
although it is built upon a more generous plan and is more richly
painted. It is brownish, mottled with white and yellow patches, and is
very suggestive of certain kinds of birds' eggs. The animals have a
greatly extended mantle which almost completely envelops the shell.
The foot is extremely large, with great wing-like developments upon
each side, called parapodia. Some species of <em class="e000I2">Bulla</em> have been seen to
swim by means of the lazy flapping of the parapodia. (<a href="#Plate-LXV">Plate LXV.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead">SEA-HARES</p>

<p>Closely allied to these outer-shell-bearing opisthobranchs is a
large and important group of tectibranchs, known as
<a id="pg352"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg352]</span>
"sea-hares." They have a mantle so greatly developed that it
actually covers the shell, and its edges unite and fuse over the
top. The shell, in consequence, having almost ceased to be of
use as a protection, has degenerated into a mere horny plate,
and has lost all resemblance to the ordinary gasteropod shell.
Having practically lost its protective office and become a mere
internal plate, it is quite probable that it will in time wholly
disappear. The gills of the sea-hares are concealed under a flap
of the mantle, their position being posterior to the heart. The
most conspicuous representative of this type of tectibranchs in
the United States is the following:</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em>
 <em class="eB00I2">Aplysia</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. Wilcoxii.</em> This species appears at times in vast numbers in the
waters of Florida, until the sea may truly be said to be fairly alive with
them. They swim lazily with a waving motion of the parapodia. They
disappear as mysteriously as they come, and for months not a specimen
will be seen. There is a variety of this Floridian <em class="e000I2">Aplysia</em> which occurs
at Cape May, but no sea-hares are to be found north of that point. The
tropical Pacific furnishes an astonishing wealth of these creatures,
belonging to many genera and species, and among them are some of the
most beautiful of the invertebrate animals.</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em>
 <em class="eBU003">NUDIBRANCHIATA</em></h6>

<p>The opisthobranchs are divided into two suborders, the second
of which is called <em class="e000I2">Nudibranchiata</em>.
The name is well chosen and
very suggestive, for it means "naked or exposed gills"; but this
anatomical feature is only one of the peculiarities of this suborder.
The nudibranchs are commonly known as "sea-slugs"; for, like
the land-slugs, which are also true mollusks, they possess no
shell at all. That they at one time carried a shell is evident from
the fact that they are born with a rudimentary testaceous covering,
which soon afterward disappears.</p>

<p>A striking peculiarity of the nudibranchs is that the conventional
molluscan mantle is not usually apparent. Instead of
seeing the usual flaps or folds of the mantle which more or less
encircle mollusks, and which one seems to have a right to expect,
<a id="pg353"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg353]</span>
they are entirely absent, and the body of the sea-slug assumes in
consequence a worm-like appearance. Other notable features of
the nudibranchs are the great number of tentacular processes that
usually project from the dorsal region of the animal, and, in many
of the genera, an entire absence of gills. When the gills are
present, as is the case in several of the nudibranch families, they
are not placed along the side of the animal, where one would
naturally look for them, but are arranged in the form of a
rosette of plume-like processes situated in the posterior dorsal
region, or, in other words, on the animal's back.</p>

<p>Nudibranchs are commonly to be found all along the Atlantic
and Pacific coasts of North America, and more especially in the
colder waters north of Cape Cod. They are essentially littoral,
and live upon algæ in shallow water, upon eel-grass in sheltered
places, and in tide-pools, where there is more or less vegetation.
They crawl about the fronds of algæ, or swim, foot upward, with
a gentle and undulating motion, or, when caught between tides,
may be seen clinging to the under surface of rocks. Protective
resemblances have been so remarkably developed in the nudibranchs
that they are not always easy to discover; indeed, one
may actually be looking at one for some time without suspecting it
to be other than some torn fragment of seaweed.</p>

<p><br />There are many species belonging to several genera which frequent
the Maine and Massachusetts coasts, but those most likely
to be encountered are the following:</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Dendronotus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. arborescens.</em> This species is about one inch long and variable
in color, but is usually reddish-brown or rose. There are no tentacles,
but in their place are two antler-like appendages pointing forward and
branched like a tree. All along the back are two rows of these curiously
branched processes, which give to the animal the appearance of a plant.
These <em class="e000I2">cerata</em>, or dorsal papillæ, are delicately transparent, contractile,
and richly colored. The function of these papillæ is not fully known.
As the animal has no specialized breathing-organs, it is reasonable to
suppose that respiration is carried on through the outer skin and perhaps
all over the surface of these branched papillæ. The liver, which
<a id="pg354"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg354]</span> in most nudibranchs is extremely large and completely surrounds the
stomach, in <em class="e000I2">Dendronotus</em> also extends into these dorsal cerata, so that
they may have some sort of digestive function.</p></div>

</div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em>
 <em class="eB00I2">Æolis</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">Æ. papillosa.</em> This is probably the commonest nudibranch upon
the North Atlantic coast, and it occurs as frequently in European
waters. It may readily be found clinging to stones, algæ, the piling of
wharves, eel-grass, etc., in bays or in rocky tide-pools. The color is
yellowish-gray to orange, with purplish or olive
spots. The cerata are very numerous, and cover the
dorsal portion of the animal save for an open space
along the middle of the back. There are two sets of
tentacles, the two dorsal and the two simple labial
tentacles. The foot tapers behind to a sharp point,
and is truncate in front. As in <em class="e000I2">Dendronotus</em>, the
liver is diffused into the cerata, which in <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em> are
simple tubular processes without the branching
character of those of the former. Both species lay
their eggs in a gelatinous, bobbin-like cord, which
is hung in festoons over rocks or upon zoöphytes, or
at times they wind the cord in a coil upon the surfaces
of stones. When the young first hatch out,
they are provided with a glassy nautiloid shell, a fact
which would indicate that at some remote period they
were, like most mollusks, provided with a shell. <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em> swims in an inverted
position, and is at times exceedingly active. It is very variable in
coloring and in the number of cerata.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Doris</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. bilamellata.</em> In <em class="e000I2">Doris</em> we find a quite different type of nudibranch
from that presented by the two genera <em class="e000I2">Dendronotus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Æolis</em>.
In one there were numerous branched cerata or dorsal papillæ, in the
other many plain cerata, and in neither case were there any specialized
<a id="pg355"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg355]</span> breathing-organs. In <em class="e000I2">Doris</em>, however, there are no dorsal papillæ at all,
the back being covered with calcareous spicules, which form a sort of
secondary shell. There is a circlet,
or rosette, of retractile
plume-like gills, or branchiæ,
placed in the middle of the back
posteriorly. There are various
species of <em class="e000I2">Doris</em>, and of closely
allied genera belonging to the
family <em class="e000I2">Dorididæ</em>, which are to be
found along the New England
coast in tide-pools and among
rocks. Those seen by the writer never appeared to be other than very
sluggish creatures, and proved to be rather unsatisfactory tenants of the
aquarium.</p></div>

<p>When discovered at low tide upon moist seaweed or stones, or
when disturbed in the water, nudibranchs often appear like small
lumps of jelly-like tissue, without a single attractive feature. It
is only when they are placed in a jar of sea-water and left unmolested
for a few moments that they unfold their beauties to the
view. On the Pacific coast there are numerous species of nudibranchs,
occupying corresponding shore stations and exhibiting
the same degree of high coloration. There are over a thousand
species of sea-slugs scattered about the various seas. They find
their greatest development in tropical waters, and for brilliancy
of tint and variation in form are unequaled by any other class of
animal life, save perhaps the butterflies.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">PROSOBRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p>To this exceedingly large and comprehensive order of gasteropods
belong the great majority of univalve mollusks. In point
of number of genera and species and in abundance of individuals,
the prosobranchs probably exceed all the other orders of mollusks
combined. They may be called the typical gasteropods, the
shell being univalvular and generally spiral, and the animal exhibiting
the singular torsion of the visceral mass which has placed
the breathing-organs forward of the heart. They are provided
with an operculum (placed upon the posterior dorsal portion of
the foot), which is used to close the aperture of the shell against <a id="pg356"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg356]</span>
enemies when the animal retires within its fortress. They are
all marine except a very few families, which, supposedly of marine
derivation, have become terrestrial in habit.</p>

<p>The prosobranchs are further subdivided into suborders according
to certain peculiarities of the heart and breathing-organs.
There is a group of these prosobranchs which gives evidence of
an inferior degree of that visceral torsion which is always found
in the gasteropods. In this group, or suborder, the heart has two
auricles, and there is a pair of gills instead of only a single one.
Other internal organs are paired just as they were represented to
be in the schematic mollusk. This group also seems to show its
primitive character in the want of a proboscis and a siphon, or,
in some families, by having the ventricle of the heart traversed
by the intestinal canal, just as in the lower class of mollusks,
which includes the clams and oysters. For the most part the
shells of this group are not typically spiral, but are patelliform,
shield-like coverings, with only a suggestion of a spiral form at
the very tip of the apex. This group of primitive prosobranchs
is included in the following suborder:</p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em> <em class="eBU003">DIATOCARDIA</em></h6>

<p>This suborder is named from the presence of two auricles in
the heart.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">ACMÆIDÆ</em></p>

<p>The first family to be noted is the <em class="e000I2">Acmæidæ</em>. Its principal
genus, <em class="e000I2">Acmæa</em>, is well represented on both the east and the west
coast of the United States.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Acmæa</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. testudinalis.</em> This species is found in vast numbers all along the
New England shore, clinging to the rocks between tides. They are usually
called limpets. The shell is solid, conical, with an oval outline, and
with no trace of a spiral form in the adult. When the shell is thoroughly
cleaned, it generally presents a mottled coloration of pale green,
brown, and white. Inside it is white and nacreous, with a large brown
<a id="pg357"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg357]</span> area under the apex. The animal has a powerful foot, by means of
which it is enabled to cling to a rock with great strength. In order to
dislodge it, it is necessary to approach carefully, and, taking the creature
unawares, quickly slip a broad knife-blade under the foot, otherwise
it is quite impossible to tear it from its resting-place. <em class="e000I2">A. testudinalis</em> lives
entirely between tides, and ranges from the northernmost
waters to New York. It feeds upon algæ and is a very
sluggish animal. It has been said to leave its resting-place
and wander about in search of food, returning to its original
and usual spot when the tide begins to ebb. (<a href="#pg343">Page 343</a>.)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. testudinalis,</em> variety <em
class="eB00I2">alveus.</em> This variety is smaller, more fragile,
and oblong. It lives upon eel-grass, its oblong shell being
adapted to the narrow leaves of the grass. The coloration is
brighter—reddish-brown spots on a white surface. It is exceedingly
common on the New England coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. mitra.</em> On the Pacific coast there are
a number of acmæas. <em class="e000I2">A. mitra</em> is often found
dead upon the beaches. It is conical in form and pure creamy-white
in color. It looks very much like a clown's pointed cap.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. patina.</em> This is also very abundant in California. Outside it is
dark in color and is often incrusted with mineral deposits. Within there
is a dark ring around the edge, then a zone of bluish-white, and a patch of
brown just beneath the apex.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">HALIOTIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Haliotis</em></p>

<p>This family is closely allied to the <em class="e000I2">Fissurellidæ</em>. The species are
known on the Pacific coast by the name of abalone shells, and in
England and the Channel Islands as ormers or sea-ears. There
are no species of <em class="e000I2">Haliotis</em> on the east coast of the United States,
but one has recently been dredged at a considerable depth in West
Indian waters. This family, with the last, possesses the striking
anatomical feature of having the heart traversed by the digestive
tract. It also has two gills, the degree of torsion in the visceral
mass not being sufficient to have crowded out and destroyed the
original right gill. The shell is spiral, but is so greatly flattened,
and the body-whorl is so greatly extended, that the shell quite
loses the spiral appearance. Along the dorsal side of the shell is
a row of holes, through which project numerous tentacular processes
from the mantle. The outer surface of the shell, before it is
polished, is usually rough and unattractive, but within, when the
<a id="pg359"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg359]</span>
animal is removed, it displays a most beautiful and highly colored
nacreous surface. The spot near the center of the inner shell
surface where the muscles of the foot were attached is usually
most brilliantly colored. The shell of the abalone is susceptible
of taking a very high degree of polish, and is extensively used in
commerce for colored mother-of-pearl and for inlaid work.
<em class="e000I2">Haliotis</em>
is a vegetable-feeding genus. They cling with great tenacity
to rocks about low tide, and it requires skill to remove them without
breaking the shell. There are several species in California.
The Chinese use the abalone for food, and have waged a persistent
war upon the family along the Pacific coast until the specimens
are not nearly as common as formerly. They are also eaten
in France and in Japan.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. splendens.</em> The largest and perhaps the most attractive in
appearance of the Californian species. Speaking of this beautiful shell,
Professor Keep says: "Within, a whole rainbow is condensed in one of
the magnificent shells, though the shades of green are most conspicuous.
The coloring in the center is particularly fine, resembling a peacock's
tail. There are about six open holes near one side of the shell, and its
length is about the same number of inches." (<a href="#Plate-LXVI">Plate LXVI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. rufescens.</em> A large abalone, which sometimes attains a length of
eight or nine inches. It is red in color, with three open holes in the
body-whorl. The outer portion of the shell is usually incrusted with
mineral deposit and overgrown with vegetation.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">H. cracherodii.</em> Very dark green without, with five to nine holes;
length from one to six inches; spire exceedingly short. Common on the
Californian coast in crevices of rocks at low tide.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">TROCHIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This is one of the largest and most interesting families of the
<em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>. It contains many apparently widely separated genera
and a host of species, which for the most part are littoral, the
majority actually living between tide-marks. The typical trochid
shell is top-shaped or pyramidal, having a broad base and many
closely wound flat whorls terminating in a sharp apex. All the
trochids are nacreous within the aperture—a character which is
constant throughout the family. The animal has but one gill
(the left), a short snout, and often frontal lobes on the head.
The edge of the mantle or the epipodial line of the foot is usually
ornamented with from three to five cirri. The tentacles are <a id="pg360"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg360]</span>
long and slender, with short peduncles for the eyes; the operculum
is corneous, with a central nucleus. The animals are herbivorous,
feeding upon algæ. The trochids are essentially tropical
shells, and the most of the genera which are comprised in the
family are only to be encountered in the warm waters of the
Pacific and Indian oceans. Some forms are very beautiful, and
frequently are used as mantel ornaments, and the shells of one
little species, which is opalescent in its coloring, are still extensively
gathered in the East Indies, to be polished and strung like
pearls in necklaces.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Margarita</em></p>

<p>On the Atlantic coast north of Cape Cod the trochids are represented
by the genus <em class="e000I2">Margarita</em>, with five or six species. The
shells are small, thin, and globosely depressed, with smooth or
transversely striated whorls. The aperture is nearly circular,
with a simple lip.</p>

storms have torn these great algæ from the bottom and
cast them upon the shore. At Bar Harbor they are common
upon the eel-grass in Rodicks Weir. This species can
generally be distinguished by its iridescent, metallic luster.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. undulata.</em> A commoner species, perhaps, than
either of the preceding, sometimes found on the rocks of sheltered

excellent food by the cod and its allied species which
thrive along the Maine coast. No doubt millions of <em class="e000I2">M. undulata</em>
are yearly destroyed in this way. The shell is depressed,
with four rounded whorls, a flattish base, and a large umbilical
opening. In color it varies from rose-red to brown. The surface is decorated
with numerous revolving raised lines placed at uniform distances.
Just below the suture the body-whorl is somewhat undulated with short
folds. Height three tenths of an inch, base four tenths of an inch. <a id="pg361"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg361]</span></p></div>

it. It is shining nacreous within and without, and has strong
revolving ribs, the upper one on each whorl often being
broken into a circular row of white dots. The lip is crenulated.
This very pretty species is not likely to be met with
upon the shore, but may be dredged in shallow water on
gravelly bottoms along the Maine coast. Height about
one half of an inch.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. jujubinum.</em> A species which occurs in the waters of Florida.
Its form is almost that of a true pyramid. The sutures can scarcely be
distinguished. The shell is marked by brown and purplish-red spots on
a white background, and has numerous revolving ribs broken into rows
of white dots like little glazed beads. The umbilicus is funnel-shaped
and wide. In Tampa Bay this shell is frequently found on sponges, and
may sometimes be gathered on the beach after storms, even as far north
as Hatteras. There are as many as twenty species of this genus in American
Atlantic waters, but they are either rare or have deep-water stations.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. annulatum.</em> A remarkable species of <em class="e000I2">Calliostoma</em>, found in California.
The whorls are adorned with revolving rows of raised dots, and
the sutures are frescoed in exquisite purple. This beautiful species lives
upon seaweed, and on pleasant days comes to the surface of the water.
It can then be collected from a boat by drawing in quantities of seaweed.
It is very unlikely that the collector will ever find a specimen
upon the beach, for the shell is too fragile to withstand the rough handling
of the waves. Length one inch.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. canaliculatum.</em> The largest member of this genus to be found
in American waters. It resembles the last species in form, but lacks the
purple sutures. The revolving ribs are very numerous and prominent.
There is no umbilicus. Length one to one and a half inches. Found on
the Pacific coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. costatum.</em> A heavier shell than the preceding, with somewhat
more rounded whorls. Reddish-brown in color; numerous revolving
ridges; no umbilicus; about three quarters of an inch in length. It is
found in rocky places, and sometimes in considerable numbers, just at
low-tide mark. Found in California. <a id="pg362"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg362]</span></p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Chlorostoma</em></p>

<p>This genus is represented in California by several species, the
commonest of which is probably <em class="e000I2">C. funebrale</em>—a doleful name, no
doubt given on account of the jet-black color.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. funebrale.</em> The shell is thick and strong, like most between-tide
species, which are constantly exposed to the buffeting of the waves. It
is to be found in countless thousands upon rocks exposed at low tide,
and may be gathered at any time except full flood-tide, like the littorinas
and purpuras of the east coast. Within the aperture the surface is
nacreous and greenish in tint; the last whorl is drawn in, like gathers,
at the suture. The umbilicus is closed. There is a white nodule at the
base of the lip of the columella. Length one half of an inch to one inch.
(<a href="#Plate-LXVII">Plate LXVII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. brunneum.</em> This species is brown, as its name would indicate,
and there is greenish nacre within the aperture. It lives upon kelp, or
upon rocks at very low tide. Length about an inch. (<a href="#Plate-LXVI">Plate LXVI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Trochiscus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. norrisi.</em> A flattened shell with rounded, dome-like spire and
obtuse apex; a fairly common species. It has a wide, deep umbilicus
and a sharp lip. It is of a rich brown color, with dark chestnut about
the umbilical region and greenish-white within the umbilicus; there is
a band of dark olive-green about the inner margin of the lip. The shell
is about two inches in diameter and of a somewhat greater height. The
operculum is multispiral, with a central nucleus, and is shaggy and
rough. Like all other trochids, it feeds upon algæ. It is often found
upon the beach after violent storms. Found in California, south of San
Francisco. (<a href="#Plate-LXVI">Plate LXVI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Livona</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. pica.</em> This large and interesting trochid is a West Indian species
which sometimes occurs in Florida. It lives about coral reefs and rocky
shores, attaching itself in vast numbers to the rocks. This shell is a
favorite refuge for large hermit-crabs. It is a curious sight in certain
of the West India islands to see a <em class="e000I2">Livona pica</em> shell scrambling up a tree,
looking very much out of place upon the back of some terrestrially inclined
crustacean. When well cleaned it is a beautiful shell, with black
wavy lines over a greenish-white nacreous foundation. The animal has
a row of waving cirri upon each side of the mantle, and long, slender
tentacles. It is largely used as an article of diet in the West Indies and
Central America. (<a href="#Plate-LXVII">Plate LXVII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">TURBINIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This family is very closely allied to the trochids, the most
striking difference being in the operculum, which in the <em class="e000I2">Turbinidæ</em>
is calcareous and usually smooth and very convex on the outside.
<a id="pg363"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg363]</span> The shells are nacreous within, and the animal, with its
rows of
waving cirri upon each side, is very suggestive of <em class="e000I2">Trochus</em>.
They are, for the most part, shallow-water or littoral forms.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Turbo</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. castaneus.</em> This species has a range as far north as Cape Hatteras,
and is especially abundant at Tampa, on the west coast of Florida. The
peculiar operculum is sufficient to identify the genus at once. One
variety of this species has a crenulated shoulder upon the body-whorl
and is referred to as <em class="eB00I2">Turbo crenulatus</em>, A series of intermediate
forms establishes the specific identity of the two varieties. (<a href="#Plate-LXVII">Plate LXVII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">NERITIDÆ</em></p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Neritidæ</em> are strictly littoral forms, almost entirely confined
to the warmer waters of tropical seas. The animal preserves the
usual diatocardian features—has a short snout and long tentacles.
Unlike the trochids and <em class="e000I2">Turbo</em>, it has no cirri along the
epipodial margin. The shells are peculiarly shaped, the spire
being greatly flattened and scarcely noticeable on account of the
unduly large development of the body-whorl; thus the shell takes
on a decidedly patelliform appearance. It is without an umbilicus.
In the principal genus <em class="e000I2">Nerita</em> the outer lip is sharp on the edge,
but greatly thickened just within.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Nerita</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. peleronta.</em> This shell has two teeth on the wide, flat columellar
lip, and about them is a blotch of red, suggesting blood. The common
name of this shell, "bleeding-tooth," is very appropriate. Found in
southern Florida. (<a href="#Plate-LXVII">Plate LXVII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. tessellata</em> is a smaller species, with heavy revolving ribs, and is
further decorated with transverse oblique black lines. The operculum
is calcareous. Both of these species have the habit of absorbing the
entire inner portion of their shells. They belong to the West Indian
fauna, and occur in great numbers on rocky or coral shore stations.
They also may be found on the east Florida coast, well to the south.
A third species, <em class="eB00I2">N. versicolor</em>, often occurs, associated with the other
two. It is somewhat smaller than the others and can easily be distinguished
by the four teeth on the columellar lip, the edge of the
columella being convex. (<a href="#Plate-LXVII">Plate LXVII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Neritina</em></p>

<p>The genus <em class="e000I2">Neritina</em> is very closely allied to the last, having
quite the same form of shell; but it is usually more globular and <a id="pg364"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg364]</span>
variously ornamented by bright spots or zigzag lines of coloration.
The neritinas have acquired the habit of ascending rivers,
until they have become almost wholly a brackish-&#160;or fresh-water
genus. The metropolis of this genus is in the South Sea Islands,
where it attains a wonderful development in the clear running
streams of the volcanic islands.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. reclivata.</em> A very pretty olive-green species, with very fine, wavy,
longitudinal lines of coloration, found in almost all Floridian streams
above the action of the tide. The nacre of the columella and within
the aperture is bluish-green, and the operculum is rich olive. (<a href="#Plate-LXVI">Plate LXVI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. viridis.</em> A small, intensely green species, which, unlike most
neritinas, is strictly marine. It belongs to the great West Indian faunal
province, but is occasionally found upon the shores of Florida and of
Texas.</p></div>

<p>The prosobranch gasteropods thus far considered (belonging to
the suborder <em class="e000I2">Diatocardia</em>) all show by their anatomical structure
that the process of visceral torsion, though carried very far within
them, has not been complete enough to crowd out and finally
destroy one of each of the paired organs. Both auricles of the
heart (with some exceptions) were left intact.</p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Suborder</em> <em class="eBU003">MONOTOCARDIA</em></h6>

<p>In this the second suborder of the prosobranch gasteropods,
the twisting visceral process has been carried to the extreme.
The heart has but one auricle. There is but one gill (on the left
side), and this is attached to the inner side of the mantle flap.
In other respects the presence of certain specialized organs would
probably indicate that gasteropods belonging to this suborder
are a step higher in the scale of life than those which belong to
the <em class="e000I2">Diatocardia</em>.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">JANTHINIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Janthina</em></p>

<p>The genus <em class="e000I2">Janthina</em> has an exceedingly thin and semi-transparent
shell, deep violet in color on the base and lighter blue on
the spire. An interesting feature of this genus is the mode of depositing
the ova. The female exudes from a gland in the foot a <a id="pg365"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg365]</span>
glutinous secretion which hardens in water, and, being filled with
air-bubbles, constitutes a float. On the under side of this are
deposited the eggs in rows of little capsules. While attached to
this float it is impossible for a <em class="e000I2">Janthina</em> to sink, and hence it is
that so many of these creatures are sacrificed in onshore gales of
wind.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">J. fragilis.</em> The shell of this species
is so brittle and fragile that it is very clearly not adapted to
a life near shore. It is in reality a pelagic species which is
occasionally blown ashore during easterly gales along the Atlantic
coast of the United States. Vast numbers of these pretty creatures
are sometimes encountered far out at sea, floating quietly on the
surface. When storms drive them upon the beach, they become utterly
helpless; since their foot is not adapted for crawling upon the
sand, they soon perish, and their brittle shells are demolished
by the surf. In Florida the beaches are sometimes fairly lined
with <em class="e000I2">Janthina</em> shells, which make a band of
purple along the high-tide mark as far as the eye can reach; then
it may be years before they again appear. (<a href="#Plate-LXVIII">Plate LXVIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em
class="eB00I2">Scala</em></p>

<p>The shells of <em class="e000I2">Scala</em> have such a
peculiar scheme of decoration that once seen they can never
be mistaken. They are generally pure white, with well-rounded
whorls, all of which are crossed at even distances by greatly
elevated and smooth ribs. Each rib represents a rest-period,
when the creature thickened the rim of the shell-aperture. The
aperture is generally round, with a continuous lip. The animal
has a retractile proboscis and long, slender tentacles with eyes
at the outer bases, and is a predaceous, <a id="pg366"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg366]</span> carnivorous creature. Some Asiatic
species of this genus, remarkable for their beauty and rarity, have
been greatly prized by collectors. A single specimen of the now
well-known <em class="eB00I2">S. pretiosa</em> of China has been
sold for two hundred dollars—a fancy price, indeed, for a shell
which can now be bought for a dollar! There are over fifty species
of <em class="e000I2">Scala</em> on the Atlantic coast, but most
of them are either rare or belong to a zone of deeper water; there
are, however, four or five species which are exceedingly common.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. lineata.</em> A species which ranges from
Hatteras to New England. It has about eight whorls, and is slightly
brownish in color. The ribs are robust and not greatly elevated;
there are from seventeen to nineteen on the body-whorl. The shell
is sometimes painted with a few revolving brownish lines.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. multistriata.</em> The transverse ribs

southward.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. groenlandica.</em> Essentially an arctic species,
which has found its way down to the New England
coast. It is readily distinguished by the flattened,
coarsely rounded, revolving ribs, which follow
the volutions of the spire. Over them are the usual transverse
heavy ribs peculiar to this genus.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. angulata.</em> The whorls touch one another only by the
ribs, of which there are nine to each volution. This species
has a remarkably wide range, occurring from Cape
Cod to southern Florida. (<a href="#Plate-LXVIII">Plate LXVIII.</a>)</p>

<p>These four species vary from one half of an inch to one inch
in length. All of them are found on the beach after storms or
may be dredged in shallow water near the shore.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">NATICIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This large and interesting family is well represented in the
Atlantic waters of the United States, but its more beautiful
members live in the tropics. The New England and New Jersey species
are dull in color, but offer much of interest to the collector
and student. The foot is enormously large, and carries in front
a great shield-like fleshy process, which curves back over the
head of the animal and serves as a plow in pushing its way through
the heavy wet sand of the beach. When the creature is thus seen
extended in the act of crawling, one wonders how it is possible
for it to withdraw so great an amount of body into its shell;
but if it is suddenly seized or irritated, it will quickly <a
id="pg367"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg367]</span> demonstrate its
ability to hide itself completely within its house and to close
the door very effectively by means of its operculum. The eyes
seem to be wanting, or they are concealed under the skin of the
head. The shell is usually quite large, with a depressed spire and
well-rounded whorls—especially the body-whorl, which appears to
be greatly swollen. The umbilicus is usually open and moderately
large, the lip simple.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. heros</em> (generally referred to as <em class="eB00I2">Lunatia</em> or <em class="eB00I2">Natica heros</em>). One
of the commonest large shells and one of the most characteristic species
of the New England and New Jersey littoral fauna. It is exceedingly
common along the Long Island shore, where it may be found on the
open beach, in pools with a sandy bottom left by the receding tide. It is
usually partially and frequently wholly buried in the sand. The umbilicus
is open and large, the operculum corneous, and the shell heavy and
ashy-white to brownish, with (when young) a yellowish epidermis. Its
length is from two to four inches. It has no ornamentation whatever. <em class="e000I2">P.
heros</em> is a most voracious creature and spends its time in hunting for
flesh—either alive or dead—to devour. It feeds upon dead fish, or
upon other mollusks whose shell it is able to pierce by means of its
radula, making a little round hole through which it sucks out the flesh
from within. The curious egg-cases of this species have already been
referred to. (See <a href="#Plate-I">Plate I</a>.)
It glues together particles of sand into the
form of a basin with the bottom knocked out and broken on one side.
In the gelatinous substance of this basin it deposits its eggs in a regular
order. These hatch out in midsummer. Egg-cases of this kind can
always be found wherever <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em> lives. For a long time naturalists
were greatly puzzled by these curious things, and their blunders are
recorded in earlier works, where these egg-cases have been elaborately
described as living animals belonging to various invertebrate orders.
The largest and best specimens of <em class="e000I2">P. heros</em> are to be found south of
Cape Cod. (<a href="#pg343">Page 343</a>.)</p>

from the columellar lip, and is chestnut in color. The surface of
the shell is smooth, often polished, ashy-white below and light
chestnut above. The operculum is corneous. The length of the shell
varies in different localities from one half of an inch to about
two <a id="pg368"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg368]</span> inches;

Its length is about one
half an inch, its color
livid white to light brown,

This species (as well as the following one) has retained the generic

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. canrena.</em> One of the handsomer species of <em class="e000I2">Natica</em>, which occurs

lines of darker purplish hue crossing them. The base of the shell is
white. The aperture is large and flaring, and is purplish within. The
umbilicus is partially closed by an entering callous plug. The operculum

<p>A very interesting species of this genus occurs on the east
coast, sparingly in New Jersey, but very abundantly south of
Hatteras. <em class="e000I2">Sigaretus</em> is a modified <em
class="e000I2">Natica</em>. The spire is flattened and minute.
The body-whorl, being greatly expanded, gives a wide, flaring,
oblique aperture. The shell is ear-shaped and white, with fine
revolving lines. There is no umbilicus. The operculum is small and
rudimentary. The animal is large, with an enormous foot and greatly
developed propodium, and is a sand-dweller. The common east-coast
form is <em class="eB00I2">S. perspectivus</em>. (<a href="#Plate-LXVIII">Plate LXVIII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. fornicata.</em> All collectors of mollusks on the Atlantic coast sooner
or later encounter this exceedingly common species adhering to oyster-shells
or scallops, and often to other large live shells.
It is cast upon the beach along the entire length
of the Atlantic coast. The shell is obliquely oval,
dull whitish in color, and either smooth or rough
or even ribbed, according to the nature of the surface
to which it clings. The spire is almost entirely
suppressed, the little inconspicuous apex being
turned to one side and closely pressed down against
the body of the shell. When looking into the interior
of the shell one is reminded of a boat, for the
upper portion of the aperture is covered by a
horizontal shelly partition, called the diaphragm,
a space being left below which would correspond
to the forecastle of a ship. The "stern" is round,
and the "bow" is suggestively pointed.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. plana.</em> In this species the shell is white and flat,
or slightly concave. Although it is pointed at the "bow"
end and square at the "stern," the nautical resemblance
stops there, because, being flat, there are no swelling
sides and bow. The diaphragm is about one half the
length of the shell, convex, shining, white, and translucent.
<em class="e000I2">C. plana</em> lives generally within the aperture of
large dead shells. It has a wide range, from Maine to
Florida.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. aculeata.</em> A common Floridian species
which has a remarkable range, being found in nearly all the
tropical and semi-tropical waters of the world. It is smaller than
<em class="e000I2">C. fornicata</em>, is reddish-brown with a white
diaphragm, and has several radiating ribs on the back, which are
inclined to be nodulous. (<a href="#Plate-LXVIII">Plate LXVIII.</a>) <a id="pg370"></a><span

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">LITTORINIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Littorina</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Littorina</em> is probably the most characteristic genus of Northern
littoral regions. Together with some of its allied genera it is
also, probably, equally characteristic of various tropical littoral
faunas all over the world. The family comprises strictly
between-the-tides genera and species. Indeed, it is suspected
that some species of <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em> are making very fair progress
toward a terrestrial condition, for they actually live above high-tide
mark,—even in the branches of overhanging trees,—and
must certainly pass days at a time out of their natural element.
That such a transformation is possible need not for a moment be
doubted, for there are many land mollusks to-day that give abundant
evidence of having been at some past time aquatic or marine
species. These changes in nature are constantly going on,
and the gradual substitution of a lung for a gill is no very startling
metamorphosis. <a id="pg371"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg371]</span></p>

<p>The littorinas fairly swarm in favorable localities upon all
shore stations. In Maine and Massachusetts the bold, rocky coast
furnishes a home for several species. Often the rocks at low tide
are black with them; the algæ that cling in wet masses to the
exposed rocks are alive with them. One cannot walk about in such
localities without crushing hundreds of specimens. Sometimes they
will be found clinging in clusters upon the piling of old wharves,
or crawling about the bottom at or about the low-tide mark. The
best specimens of <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em> are found in
stations where they are bathed twice a day by pure, uncontaminated
sea-water; those living near the mouths of streams, or where the
water is brackish or impure, are usually small and degenerate.
They are vegetable feeders, and have received the common name of
"periwinkles." In Great Britain they are used among the poorer
classes for food. The animal has a short, broad muzzle, and eyes
at the outer bases of the tentacles. The foot is longitudinally
grooved, and there is a rudimentary siphonal fold in the mantle.
The shells are turbinated, usually heavy, few-whorled, and with a
round aperture.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. litorea.</em> This is supposed to be an
importation from the Old World—to have come over by way of Iceland
and Greenland, and then to have migrated down the Labrador coast.
For many years Cape Cod formed a barrier to its advance, but now
the species is abundant at Newport, and is reported at New York. It
occurs on the Maine coast in astonishing numbers, living in vast
colonies on the rocks exposed at low tide. The shell is thick,
imperforate (no umbilicus), and usually has flat, spiral ribs.
The columella is broad and white; the lip thin and black. The
general color varies from black to olive or to dingy gray—sometimes
reddish. The operculum is corneous, with the nucleus near the
outer edge. Despite the variableness of this very common shell
(the variations being chiefly in the height of the spire), it has
certain unmistakable characteristics which, once seen, will enable
the collector to determine it at once.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. rudis.</em> A smaller species than the last. It is strong
and coarse, with revolving grooves and ribs, or smooth, with
interrupted whitish bands and spots. A very common variety
of this species is much smaller than the typical form,
being about one sixth to one fourth of an inch long, smooth,
with white and yellowish spots on olive. It clings to the rocks
near high-tide mark, and is usually found attached to its
resting-place by a bit of hardened mucus. While the typical <em class="e000I2">L. rudis</em>
is heavy and banded, with a moderately high spire and no color, this
<a id="pg372"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg372]</span> variety is thinner, with a higher spire and smoother surface, and has a
color-scheme of decoration. It would be impossible to disconnect the
two, for a large series of specimens will demonstrate beyond doubt,
through every minute degree of variation, that the two forms belong to
one and the same species. The station of <em class="e000I2">L. rudis</em> is much the same as
that of <em class="e000I2">L. litorea</em>, but the smaller colored variety of <em class="e000I2">rudis</em> prefers quieter
and more sheltered spots. It is occasionally found on reeds and grasses,
on the piling of wharves, on large boulders above the line of algæ, and
on algæ. It has been the writer's experience not to find <em class="e000I2">rudis</em> and <em class="e000I2">litorea</em>
associated together.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. palliata.</em> A low-spired, globular shell with a large, tumid, smooth
body-whorl. The columella is flattened, curved below, and imperforate.
The color is exceedingly variable, but is usually bright, shining olive,
and this is especially the case with those individuals that find
their station in the dense masses of algæ that form so conspicuous
a feature of a low-tide scene on a rocky New England
coast. From pure olive-green to yellow or bright red, with
revolving black bands, seems a long chromatic leap, but it is
not too great for the Designer of these pretty little globular
shells. As a rule, the color of the shell simulates pretty
closely that of the seaweed upon which it lives, and inexperienced
eyes may easily overlook hundreds of specimens, all within close reach.
The banded varieties are less common. The head of the animal is
somewhat orange in color, the foot slate. The distinguishing features
of this species are the smooth, globular shell, the low spire, the broadly
flattened columella, and the orange-colored head of the animal. It is
found on <em class="e000I2">Fucus</em> between tides, and often associated with <em class="e000I2">L. rudis</em>, on
the whole coast north of New Jersey. The three preceding species
are distinctly boreal in their range, but their place is taken in southern
Atlantic waters of the United States by the following exceedingly
common species:</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. irrorata.</em> A solid, robust shell, which attains a length of about
one inch. It is in many respects suggestive of <em class="e000I2">L. litorea</em>, its Northern
relative, but the spire is higher, with straighter outlines,
and the apex is acute. The surface is ornamented
with closely set, revolving ribs; the sutures are indistinct;
the lip is thin, though thickened just within; and
the color is whitish to pale cinereous greenish, sometimes
spotted with broken brownish lines. Within it is white,
with a reddish tinge on the columella, and brownish
spots on the edge of the lip. This species ranges from
Maryland to Texas; its station is between tides.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. angulifera.</em> As the last species resembles <em class="e000I2">L. litorea</em>,
so this other common Southern form resembles a greatly
developed and large <em class="e000I2">L. rudis</em> of the smoother variety.
It has a high-spired shell, with an acute black tip. It has about six whorls,
which are variously decorated by wavy, oblique black lines and revolving
black lines broken into series of dots and larger spots near the suture.
The ground-color varies from yellow to purple. None of the colors are
very vivid. Within it is yellowish-white. This species has a much thinner
and more delicate shell than any of the littorinas thus far considered. It
is common on the piling of wharves and in sheltered nooks everywhere
<a id="pg373"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg373]</span> between tides. It is essentially a tropical species of very wide and extended
range, but it does not occur north of St. Augustine. At Tampa
it has been found in vast numbers. (<a href="#Plate-LXIX">Plate LXIX.</a>)</p>

<p>The California coast furnishes two more species of <em class="e000I2">Littorina</em>. Their
station is among the rocks between tides, and their habits are quite the
same as those of the east-coast species.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. scutulata.</em> In this species the color is of various shades, generally
dark gray, mottled with white spots. A good-sized specimen
measures one half of an inch in length. The spire is high; the
columella flattened, broad; the shell is purplish-white within the
aperture. (<a href="#Plate-LXIX">Plate LXIX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. planaxis.</em> Somewhat larger than the last; wider; with a
lower spire; grayish in color, sometimes speckled with white; chest
nut-brown within. The columella is remarkably flattened, and a
portion of the whorl next bordering the columella is excavated as
though eaten away by the animal. These two species are often found
associated on the rocks. (<a href="#Plate-LXIX">Plate LXIX.</a>)</p></div>

A curious and distinguishing feature of this genus is the
umbilicus, which forms a lengthened groove along the
columella. <em class="e000I2">L. vincta</em> rarely exceeds one half of an inch
in length, and is thin, with a pointed spire of five whorls.
It is either of a uniform horn-color, or purplish, or banded
with chestnut. It may best be found upon marine plants
in sheltered places, or may sometimes be gathered in quantity
from the roots of <em class="e000I2">Laminaria</em> washed in by storms.</p>

mostly tropical in distribution. Their shells are usually highly
ornamented in various schemes of sculpture, but they lack beauty

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. floridanum.</em> A very common species on the west coast of Florida,
also sparingly found at Hatteras. It has eight or ten whorls, a gradually
tapering spire, and a sharp apex; the aperture is oblong, with a
deeply cut anterior canal projected to the left and backward (when the
specimen is held apex up, with the aperture toward the observer). The
sculpture is elaborate, consisting of many rows of revolving ribs, and
close to the suture there are circling rows of nodes. There is a curious
hump just to the left of the aperture, which is quite characteristic of the
genus. The color is whitish-gray; the length one and a quarter to one
and a half inches. Station, shallow water in lagoons and sheltered
spots. (<a href="#Plate-LXIX">Plate LXIX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. muscarum.</em> Another Floridian species, somewhat smaller than
the last (one inch in length). It has heavy, prominent, transverse ribs
crossed by circling rows of chestnut spots, one heavy revolving rib
around the base; eight or nine whorls; a high-tapering spire; and a
sharp apex. The aperture is oblong, with the anterior canal projecting
to the left. The columella is arched; the color shining gray to very
light purplish. This very pretty little shell may be gathered literally by
the shovelful all along the west Florida coast in sheltered spots, on sandy
and shallow bottoms. (<a href="#Plate-LXIX">Plate LXIX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. minimum.</em> A still smaller Floridian shell, with jet-black aperture
and anterior canal projecting horizontally to the left. The sculpture-plan
is of revolving ribs and a series of white granules just below the
sutures. Its station is the same as that of the last. Often the bottom
of a lagoon will seem to be literally paved with these somber-hued
little shells. From Tampa Bay to Charlotte Harbor they are very
abundant.</p></div>

sinuous, and yellow; there is a very slight notch at the angle
of the columella, and the lip serves for an anterior canal. The apex is
wanting by reason of the usual truncation of two or three whorls of the
spire. There are revolving ribs on the base; longitudinal ribs elsewhere.
The color is a dingy drab; within, brownish-yellow. It is found in
brackish water in Georgia and Florida. This species is said to suspend
itself from overhanging vegetation by means of glutinous filaments. It

it as a worm which had created for itself a calcareous covering.
But it is a true prosobranch notwithstanding the fact that it has
departed widely from the conventional design in the fashioning
of its shell. At first the shell starts out in a regular form,
and then the whorls become separated, finally wandering about in
a seemingly aimless manner. The irregular prolongation sometimes
measures ten inches in length. The animal is in no way remarkable
except in having the viscera greatly elongated and the foot very
short and broad. The color of the animal is light brown with black
spots; the shell-color is rufous or ashy-white. Shells of this

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em>
 <em class="eBU003">STROMBIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This is a particularly interesting family, but it is tropical, and
is represented on the shores of the United States by only one <a id="pg376"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg376]</span>
genus, <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em>, of which we have but a few species. <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em> is
a scavenger,—a buzzard among mollusks,—and its sense of smell
is evidently very acute. Its eyes are much more highly developed
than the usual gasteropod visual organs, and they are placed
at the tip-ends of two very substantial eye-stalks or-pedicels.
The tentacles are slender and project from the eye-pedicels. The
foot is curiously developed; that portion of it which would naturally
constitute the creeping-disk is exceedingly small, but the
metapodium (the hinder part of the foot, upon which the operculum
is situated) is very large. The corneous operculum upon its
end, which is far too small to close the entrance of the shell when
the creature retires within it, looks like a claw. Instead of creeping
along the sand, <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em> proceeds by jumps or awkward
leaps, turning its heavy shell first to one side, then to the other.
The shell is usually heavy, with the outer lip greatly thickened.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Strombus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. pugilis.</em> The very common Floridian species, often three to four
inches in height, with a short spire covered with nodes or short, obtuse
spines, which are also found upon the shoulder of the body-whorl
(sometimes smooth). The aperture is long, with a wide notch in the
outer lip and a posterior canal. Living specimens have a tough, leathery
epidermis covering at least the body-whorl. The color is brownish.
The columella is covered with a fairly thick callous deposit, and, as
within the aperture, is highly polished, and deep purple, blackish-chestnut,
or vivid carnation-red in color. The smoother varieties have gone
under the name of <em class="eB00I2">S. alatus</em>, but the identity of the two species is assured.
This pugilistic <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em> is a very active mollusk, and when
placed in a boat will sometimes effect its escape over the side in a most
surprising manner. The species is very abundant in all the shallow
waters of Florida. A piece of meat on a string, left overnight in some
sheltered sandy spot where there are from six to eight feet of water,
will surely attract them. In Florida, where the waters teem with life,
unless the bait is protected in a wire cage, the chances are that the hosts
of crustaceans and fish will make away with it long before the strombs
can arrive on the scene. (<a href="#Plate-LXX">Plate LXX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">S. gigas.</em> One of the largest of gasteropods, very common on the
Florida Keys and also occurring in southern Florida. Hundreds of
thousands of these shells have been sent to Europe from the Bahamas
to be cut into cameos. This familiar shell is to be seen everywhere in
the South, placed about flower-gardens and lining the paths and walks
in yards. It is generally known in Florida and the West Indies as the
"conch-shell." The animal is used as food in Key West, and is very
generally eaten throughout the Bahamas. From their habit of eating
<a id="pg377"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg377]</span> these animals the natives of some of the Bahama Islands are themselves
called "Conchs." The rich pink color of the shell is very striking.</p>

<p>There are perhaps seventy-five or eighty species of <em class="e000I2">Strombus</em> inhabiting

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">CYPRÆIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Cypræa</em></p>

<p><em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em> is one of the "aristocratic" genera. Whether the shell
or the animal itself is considered, there is probably no genus of
mollusks which offers so much of beauty and interest to the collector
and student. The genus is a tropical one, and finds its
metropolis among the coral-fringed islands of the equatorial
Pacific. Despite their brilliant colors and general attractiveness,
the cowries—for such is their popular name—are very modest and
shy; they prefer to hide among rocks, where they may be secure
from molestation, for probably their conspicuous appearance is a
real source of danger to them. In the animal of <em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em> the mantle
is provided with two large lateral lobes, which are reflexed and
meet over the top of the shell; thus, when the mantle is fully
extended, the shell is entirely concealed. These mantle lobes are
often furnished with numerous forked, tufted, or ramified filaments.
The foot is long; there is no operculum. The color of
the animal is often very striking in its intensity. A description
of the cowry-shell is hardly necessary, so familiar is every one
with it. A deposit of enamel is made all over the shell, and its
painting and decoration, usually very elaborate, is reserved for
the adult as a final process in the artistic completion of its home.
The aperture is as long as the shell, is channeled at both ends,
and is toothed along both margins. The spire is insignificant and
is concealed by layers of enamel. In the young the shell has a
very different appearance, resembling a sharp-lipped <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>, and
its scheme of coloration may be entirely different from that employed
by the adult.</p>

<p>Among the <em class="e000I2">Cypræidæ</em> are many remarkable species. The splendid
<em class="eB00I2">Cypræa aurantia</em>, a native of the Fiji Islands, is one of the
shells most sought after by enthusiastic collectors. The natives <a id="pg378"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg378]</span>
learned its value long ago, and hold specimens of it at very substantial
prices. It is worn as an ornament by chiefs and as a mark
of distinction. The well-known <em class="eB00I2">C. moneta</em>, also a native of the
Pacific Islands, has been very extensively used as money throughout
the South Seas and in Africa. There are many collectors of
shells who confine their efforts almost exclusively to this and to
one or two of the other "aristocratic" genera. From an esthetic
point of view this is very natural, but biologically the less
pretentious mollusks are quite as interesting.</p>

<p>Of the one hundred and fifty or more species in existence only
three are to be found upon the Atlantic coast of the United States,
and the chances are decidedly against the finding of any of them
north of extreme southern Florida.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. exanthema.</em> A species not uncommon at Key West, where it may
be seen slowly crawling about the mangrove roots near the water's
edge. It attains a length of from four to six inches, and is so highly polished
that a good specimen could be used as a mirror. In color it is
shining, light chestnut, clouded with purple; the lips are a dark, very rich
chestnut; over all are whitish spots which appear to shine forth from
beneath the enamel. Lengthwise along the middle of the back is a
zone of lighter color which reflects a purplish sheen. (<a href="#Plate-LXX">Plate LXX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. spurca.</em> Another Floridian species, properly belonging to the
West Indian fauna. It is not more than one half an inch long, and is
white in color, but it is so thickly dotted with yellow spots upon the back
that it would pass for a yellow shell. The base is pure white. The surface
of the shell glistens in the light.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Trivia</em></p>

<p>In the genus <em class="e000I2">Trivia</em> the shell is shaped in every way like that of
<em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em>, but its surface is never smooth. In the middle of the
back is a longitudinal groove, from which run transverse
ribs, which continue around to and enter into the aperture. The
shells are always small, never exceeding one half of an inch in
length, and their color is generally reddish or brownish, passing
to pink.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. pediculus.</em> A Floridian species, first described by the great naturalist
Linnæus. Like most of the descriptions of the earlier naturalists,
this is very short and inadequate, and would apply equally well to almost
any <em class="e000I2">Trivia</em>. The color is rose-pink, with several large brownish
splashes on the back. The spire is entirely hidden. It is found in shallow
water in pools, and on the beach after storms. (<a href="#Plate-LXX">Plate LXX.</a>) <a id="pg379"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg379]</span></p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. quadripunctata.</em> Much smaller than the preceding; rose-red,
with four conspicuous reddish-brown dots on the back, two on each
side of the median dorsal groove. Found in Florida. (<a href="#Plate-LXX">Plate LXX.</a>)</p>

<p>On the California coast are also several species of <em class="e000I2">Trivia</em> and one
<em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em>, but they belong to the Southern California peninsula, and are
not commonly found farther north than Santa Barbara. The cowry is
called <em class="eB00I2">C. spadacea</em>; it grows to a length of about two inches, is highly
polished, with white base and sides, and is bright chestnut above. As
is usual in the cypræas, the spire is covered with enamel.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. californica.</em> A species found at Monterey and thence south. It
lacks the median dorsal groove, and has a whitish color-streak instead.
The ribs are white, and the ground-color of the shell is dark brownish-red.
These little shells, when found upon the beach, are called "coffee-shells,"
from their somewhat striking resemblance to the coffee-bean,
being flat on one side and rounded upon the other, and otherwise resembling
it in size and color. (<a href="#Plate-LXX">Plate LXX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. solandri.</em> This species may be found at Santa Barbara and San
Diego. It is twice as large as the last species, and has a very deep groove
in the back and widely separated ribs. Color rose to brown. The
groove on the back penetrates into the white portion of the shell.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">DOLIIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This small family furnishes two conspicuously handsome species
belonging to the genus <em class="e000I2">Dolium</em>, which range from Hatteras
southward into the West Indies.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Dolium</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. galea</em> and <em class="eB00I2">D. perdix</em>. The animal in both of these species has a relatively
large foot, which spreads out while in the act of creeping and seems
far too bulky ever to be withdrawn into the shell. It is square in front,
and, bulging out far to each side, tapers to a blunt point behind. The
most noticeable feature of the animal, however, is the great development
of its proboscis, which is quite as long as the shell itself. The
siphon is also long and is curved over the back of the shell. The
operculum is wanting in adult specimens. The shell of <em class="e000I2">D. galea</em> sometimes
attains a length of eight inches, with a diameter of about six inches;
the other species is not quite so large. They are both ventricose,
thin, inflated shells, with large body-whorls and crenulated lips. Both
are slightly umbilicated and ornamented with revolving, regularly spaced
ribs. The ribs of <em class="e000I2">D. perdix</em> are not so highly raised, but they are painted
with light reddish-brown spots. <em class="e000I2">D. galea</em> is white, with a lower spire and
deeply channeled sutures. (<a href="#Plate-LXXI">Plate LXXI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Pyrula</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. papyratia.</em> One of the commonest as well as one of the handsomest
of American shells. It is a Floridian species, found in shallow
water and on sandy bottoms. The animal greatly resembles that
<a id="pg380"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg380]</span> of <em class="e000I2">Dolium</em>, except that it has two side-flaps, which, when extended,
partially inclose the shell. The shell is thin, with an almost flat spire
and a greatly enlarged body-whorl. The aperture is flaring, and is
drawn out anteriorly into a tapering canal, which gives to the shell the
outlines of a pear. The ornamentation is revolving, but not highly
raised, and there are ribs with very distinct longitudinal lines of growth
between. The color is pure white, or sometimes yellowish, with rufous
spots; within it is golden. This attractive shell is usually from three
to four inches in length, but is sometimes found considerably larger.
(<a href="#Plate-LXXI">Plate LXXI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">CASSIDIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Cassis</em></p>

<p>The cassides, commonly known as the "helmet-shells," are carnivorous
mollusks, which lead an active life in sandy stations,
prowling about in search of bivalves, upon which they prey.
They have a large siphon and a fairly large and extensible proboscis.
The foot is broad and strong, being well adapted for plowing
through the sand. The shell of <em class="e000I2">Cassis</em> is large, generally
heavy and inflated, with a short spire and a short, recurved anterior
canal. The lip is much thickened. Upon the Atlantic coast
of North America there are four species of <em class="e000I2">Cassis</em>. They are all
properly West Indian in their faunal relations, but have found
lodgment on the American shore at various points. All of them
have been taken in the neighborhood of Cape Hatteras, two of
them in West Florida, and two in Texas.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. tuberosa.</em> A large, heavy shell, often from six to eight inches in
length, with a flattened spire. The aperture is long and narrow, with
large white teeth upon the outer lip, which is also greatly thickened.
The columellar lip is ribbed. A heavy deposit of enamel to the left of
the columellar lip gives the shell a triangular outline. A row of very
large nodes upon the shoulder of the body-whorl and two rows of obsolete
nodes below are characteristic features of this species. The color is
light yellowish-brown suffused with pink. The aperture and the columellar
callosity are flesh-tinted, with chestnut trimmings. The anterior canal
is deep and recurved.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. cameo.</em> A species of about the same size as the last, but more
ovate or ventricose in form. It is coarsely striated, with elevated growth-lines,
and has circling rows of large, rib-like elevations, having sometimes
nodes upon the body-whorl. The columella is conspicuously
ribbed and greatly expanded. The outer lip is thickened, and has
lamelliform teeth within. Flesh-colored; teeth white; purple-brown
trimmings. A great many of these shells are sent yearly from Nassau
<a id="pg381"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg381]</span> to Italy, where they are used in cameo-cutting. It is owing to the fact
that the substance of these shells is deposited in layers of different colors
that they are available for this purpose. There are about fifty species
of helmet-shells, the one most valued for cameo-cutting being known
as the black helmet, <em class="e000I2">C. Madagascarensis</em>.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. testiculus.</em> A species found outside of the West Indies only at
Key West and at Hatteras, where the Gulf Stream has brought so many
West Indian forms, and left them at the point where it takes its oblique
course away from the shore. This pretty species is smaller than the
others just described. It has a low, depressed spire; longitudinal ribs
crossing wide, flat revolving ribs; a long, narrow aperture; and a
reflexed and thickened outer lip, also toothed. The columella is thickened
and ribbed. The anterior canal is recurved over the back of the
shell, as is usual in the genus. The color is bluish, with dark spots.
There are square black spots on the reflexed lip; the aperture is pink,
and the teeth and columellar ribs white. This species is exceedingly
common at Nassau, and plays havoc with the more slowly moving
bivalves, which it devours. (<a href="#Plate-LXXI">Plate LXXI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. inflata.</em> Perhaps the commonest species of <em class="e000I2">Cassis</em> on our coast.
It is reported to be common at Beaufort, South Carolina, yet it is not so
frequently met with out of the West Indies as some earlier collectors
would have us believe. Beach-worn specimens, however, are not
unusual all along the Florida coast. It attains a size of from three to
four inches, and is a rounded, globose, ventricose shell, with a higher spire
than is usual in this genus. The surface is almost smooth, the series of
revolving ribs being scarcely raised on the body-whorl. The lip is
thickened and reflexed, with prominent lamelliform teeth which continue
as internal ribs. The lower portion of the columella is calloused and
roughly granulated. The color is bluish-white, glazed, with large square
brown spots. The region of the aperture is pure white. The collector
should not remain content with a specimen or two of the poor beach-worn
shells of this species. In general, this advice applies to the collection of
all specimens. One can get no idea of the sculpturing and painting of
shells from dead and worn specimens. It is quality rather than quantity
that makes an interesting cabinet. (<a href="#Plate-LXXI">Plate LXXI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">MURICIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Subfamily</em> <em class="eBU003">MURICINÆ</em></p>

<p>It seems like making a long leap to pass suddenly from the
<em class="e000I2">Cassididæ</em> to the <em class="e000I2">Muricidæ</em>. In the natural biological order, as it
appears in our present state of knowledge, a host of families and
genera intervene between these two. But they are omitted here,
either because they do not conspicuously occur upon our own
shores, or because they are free-swimming pelagic mollusks,
which live only far out at sea and rarely are found on the beaches.
The family <em class="e000I2">Muricidæ</em> is an exceedingly large one, including a <a id="pg382"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg382]</span>
bewildering number of well-characterized genera. It has many
representatives in every sea, but, as is apt to be the case, the
finest and most striking species are tropical. The animal is not
peculiar in any way, being altogether a conventional prosobranch
gasteropod, with moderately long foot, and the usual tentacles
placed upon a small head. There is a retractile proboscis, which
suggests carnivorous habits. In reality the <em class="e000I2">Muricidæ</em> are perfect
pirates among the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>, attacking nearly every species
they encounter, piercing its shell and devouring the unfortunate
inhabitant. They live in rocky and gravelly places or about
coral reefs. Their shells are seldom colored, except about the aperture.
What the shells lack in color, however, they fully gain in
oddness of form and in sculpturing. The anterior canal varies
from a mere notch to an astonishingly long channel. The tendency
to nodes, varices, spires, and varicose processes in general
is a prominent feature of the family.</p>

<p>There are several genera, with numerous species, upon the east
and west coasts of the United States, but we can do no more here
than mention those which are very common.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Murex</em></p>

<p>Of this tropical genus there are two Floridian species—<em class="e000I2">M.
rufus</em> and <em class="e000I2">M. pomum</em>. The genus has been very extensively
divided into subgenera, based upon shell-characters alone. Some
of these subgenera are usually accepted at full generic value, and
their substitution for the old, well-established name <em class="e000I2">Murex</em> is to
be expected. These two Floridian species fall within different
subgeneric lines, and the student who goes to a museum to compare
his catch with the labeled specimens on exhibition will
probably be puzzled to find his two murices named <em class="e000I2">Chicoreus
rufus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Phyllonotus pomum</em> respectively. But for our purposes
the name <em class="e000I2">Murex</em> will do well enough.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. rufus.</em> This species scarcely ever exceeds three inches in length.
Its spire is moderately high, and the aperture is oblong-ovate, with a
long, slightly curved, and almost completely inclosed anterior canal.
Through the end of this the fleshy siphon projects in life. The shell is
most extravagantly sculptured—so intricately that it is difficult to
<a id="pg383"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg383]</span>  describe it. Its most conspicuous feature is the large foliaceous varices
which cross the whorls, projecting almost one fourth of an inch from the
body of the shell. Between each of these varices is a large node. There
is, besides all this, a system of pronounced revolving ribs which cross
the varices and nodes, giving to the shell a greatly roughened appearance.
The interior is bluish-white. The operculum is corneous, with a
subterminal nucleus. Unfortunately, this really handsome shell is usually
incrusted with coralline or calcareous matter, which must be removed
with acid before a good idea of its appearance can be had. In color it is
reddish-brown to dark chestnut on the varices. It is very common on
the west coast of Florida, but rarer elsewhere. (<a href="#Plate-LXXII">Plate LXXII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. pomum.</em> A more abundant species, found all along the coast
from Hatteras to Texas. It is not so elongated as the last, and its sculptural
design is much less exaggerated. Between each of the varices are
two nodules. The aperture is oblong-ovate, and the anterior canal is
nearly closed and recurved toward the back. Revolving ribs cross the
varices and nodules. The color is ashen, with chestnut tips upon the
nodes and varices, and chestnut-colored patches about the aperture. The
varices are simple and not foliaceous as in <em class="e000I2">M. rufus</em>; the shell is more
globose. Length two to three inches. (<a href="#Plate-LXXII">Plate LXXII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. clathratus.</em> A fairly common shell of
the Maine coast; although it belongs to a deeper zone than that of
the tides, it is occasionally found after storms upon the shore. It
is a small fusiform shell, with many prominent longitudinal ribs
and a produced anterior canal. <em class="e000I2">Trophon</em> is a

<p>The genus <em class="e000I2">Urosalpinx</em> is closely allied to <em class="e000I2">Murex</em> and <em class="e000I2">Trophon</em>.
Several of its species are found on the east coast of the United
States.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">U. cinerea.</em> This well-known species is regarded by
Chesapeake and Long Island Sound oystermen much in the
light of a plague. These active predaceous mollusks live
upon bivalves, and preferably upon oysters. They bore a
small round hole through the shell of their helpless victims,
and then proceed to extract the succulent, fleshy animal
from within. The oystermen call them by the suggestive
name of "drill," and wage incessant warfare upon them.
In some years these mollusks appear to go into partnership
with the large starfish, <em class="e000I2">Asterias</em>, and the combination of the
two can soon destroy any oyster-bed. The original home of
this destructive little creature is presumed to be in Chesapeake
<a id="pg384"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg384]</span> Bay, but the transplanting of oyster-spat thence to Long Island
Sound has introduced the enemy at the same time. The species has a
wide range from Florida to Cape Cod, and locally north of that point;
in fact, it may be counted upon to appear wherever there are oyster-beds.
The shell is dingy gray in color, and its whorls are crossed by
a dozen or more rib-like undulations, and numerous revolving striæ.
The anterior canal is produced, and is yellowish-brown within. Length
under an inch.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. caudata.</em> A curiously flattened shell which has close
family connections with that last described. The peculiarly flat
appearance is due to the fact that there is a rather wide varix
upon each side of the shell. It is a small species, never more
than an inch in length, dingy gray, with longitudinal undulations
upon the whorls, and a long, narrow anterior canal and
crenulated lip. The animal is white and yellow, and is notable
for its activity. Found from Maine to Florida, about low-tide

<p>On the west coast of the United States occurs a striking development
of a group of the <em class="e000I2">Muricidæ</em> of a curious foliaceous appearance,

a series of rounded varices, about nine to a whorl, crossed by spiral lines.
The anterior canal is open, and just within the white aperture, upon the
inner side of the lip, is a series of five or six little round teeth. This species
frequents the waters near San Diego, and sometimes grows to be two
inches in length. (<a href="#Plate-LXXII">Plate LXXII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. lurida.</em> A much smaller species than the last, being not more than
one half to three fourths of an inch in length. Very common at Monterey
and in San Francisco Bay. It is strongly marked with spiral lines
covering the longitudinal undulations usually found in this genus, but
which are less prominently developed in this case.</p>

<p>There are several species of small ocinebras upon the California coast,
but they are not easily determined without a more critical examination
<a id="pg385"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg385]</span> than we are giving our specimens. They are <em class="eB00I2">O. interfossa</em>, a small shell
with deep spiral grooves, sharp varices, and deep sutures; and <em class="eB00I2">O. circumtexta</em>,
also small, but heavy, short-spired, with scalloped or crenulated
outer lip.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Cerostoma</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. nuttallii.</em> A species belonging to the southern coast of California.
It may be recognized at once by two prominent characters: first, a horn-like
projection from near the base of the outer lip, and, second, the tumid
varices alternating with rounded knobs. It has no spiral series of lines
like those in <em class="e000I2">Pteronotus festivus</em>; and it has a row of five or six little teeth
upon the inner side of the aperture, like those in <em class="e000I2">Ocinebra poulsoni</em>. The
anterior canal is closed. It is about two inches long. (<a href="#Plate-LXXII">Plate LXXII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. foliatum.</em> A shell somewhat like the last, but almost twice as
large, with heavy wing-like varices (three upon each whorl), made up
of overlapping plaits. The knobs between the varices are much smaller,
while the revolving ribs, though fewer in number than in most of these
west-coast murices, are heavy and large. The aperture is oblong, the
anterior canal closed. There is a "horn" near the base of the aperture,
as in <em class="e000I2">C. nuttallii</em>, but no row of teeth upon the under side of the lip.
The color is dingy white. (<a href="#Plate-LXXII">Plate LXXII.</a>)</p>

<p>In the waters of Oregon and Washington there are a few trophons and
other forms similar to the east-coast genera. These no doubt belong to
the boreal and arctic faunal provinces, and have spread over both the
Atlantic and Pacific northern regions.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Subfamily</em> <em class="eBU003">PURPURINÆ</em></p>

<p>This is considered a subfamily of the <em class="e000I2">Muricidæ</em>, and the group
therefore bears the subfamily termination <em class="e000I2">-inæ</em>. There is no
vital difference between it and the subfamily <em class="e000I2">Muricinæ</em>. The
operculum in the <em class="e000I2">Purpurinæ</em> has a lateral nucleus instead of a
subterminal one, but beyond this there are no essential differences.
The shell of the purpuras is generally heavy and solid,
being adapted to a life among rocks which are exposed to the
beating of the surf. There is a lack of that extravagant
sculptural design so characteristic of the true murices, most of
the purpuras being comparatively smooth, in order, no doubt,
that they may offer as little resistance as possible to the rushing,
seething waters of exposed rocky shores.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Purpurinæ</em>, like some of the
murices, when mutilated, exude a reddish-purple fluid. On
account of this, the ancient Romans used to gather great
quantities of certain Mediterranean forms belonging to these
families, place them in large mortars, <a id="pg386"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg386]</span> and grind them up, shell and all. A
garment dipped in the mixture and then exposed to the sun would
receive a rich purple dye. This was the basis of the famous "Tyrian
purple." The process was lost, and was rediscovered many centuries
later, but it was long ago abandoned in favor of the far superior
modern chemical dyes.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. lapillus.</em> No one who has ever spent an observant hour among the
rocks at low tide, on the shores of Massachusetts or Maine, has failed to
notice the myriads of <em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em> clinging to the barnacle-covered boulders,
or slowly creeping about in the tide-pools. This rather pretty little
mollusk is a native of Great Britain, and there
attains its greatest development and exhibits
best its marvelous range of variation. It is
presumed to be an immigrant in American
waters, having found its way across the sea
by Iceland and Greenland, and thence down
the coast. As it is a cold-water animal, and
can only survive in open, rocky stations, it will
probably never pass south of New York. It is
difficult to describe this well-known species
because it is so extremely variable. There is
an individuality about the species which causes
it to be recognized at once, yet its details are elusive. It is never more
than one and a half inches long (in the United States), and varies in color
from white through yellow to chocolate. Often it is banded in yellow
or brown. Near the only sand-beach of Bar Harbor is a colony with vermilion
bands. The shell varies from a smooth to an exceedingly rough
exterior, the latter being caused by raised scales along the lines of growth,
which make the shell even prickly to the touch. Of this latter form there
is a large colony on Campobello Island. Numerous coarse revolving
ridges are common. The columella is flattened and smooth, and its lower
portion is a little twisted. The anterior canal is short. <em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em> has
been accused of attacking clams and boring their shells, as does the predaceous
<em class="e000I2">Urosalpinx cinerea</em>, but the accusation is not well founded. <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>
is carnivorous, and no doubt destroys many young barnacles; but
with its short and small foot it would find great difficulty in digging
in the sand for clams.</p>

<p>In Florida waters there are several purpuras, which properly belong to
the West Indian fauna, but enjoy an extensive range.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. patula.</em> This species has a rounded body-whorl, and sometimes
a low spire, which give it much the appearance of a large limpet. Its
back is decorated with rows of nodules in regular order, forming a
spiral series. The chief point of distinction is the deeply excavated,
broadened, and flattened columella-lip of salmon-color. A portion of
the whorl itself is worn down and made smooth by being dragged over
sharp coral rocks, revealing underneath the rough, incrusted exterior,
a transparent colorless shelly substance. Dark and chestnut-colored
<a id="pg387"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg387]</span> patches and spots adorn the outer lip. The shell is from two to two
and a half inches long. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. hæmastoma.</em> Like its relative, <em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em> of Northern waters,
this species is so variable as almost to defy description. The form
that usually occurs from Hatteras to Florida is of a bluish-gray color,
and is indistinctly encircled with narrow yellow zones, which are crossed
by somewhat vague longitudinal waves of black. The columella and
outer lip and interior are orange-yellow. The spire is moderately high,
with a sharp apex. The whorls are noduled upon the shoulder. There
are revolving grooves throughout, even within the aperture. A Texan
variety of this species has a much more elevated spire, with channeled
sutures, and small aperture of bright salmon-color.</p>

<p>Upon the Californian coast there are three species of <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>, which
markedly resemble the <em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em> of the Maine shores. Their extreme
variability has given rise to much confusion in their nomenclature;
the multitude of names given by numerous authors to the varietal forms
of these three species constitute a list of synonyms which is appalling
to the systematic student.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. crispata.</em> With very few modifications, a description of <em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em>
would apply to this species, which occurs commonly at San Francisco
and ranges north. <em class="e000I2">Crispata</em> is possibly heavier, with a smaller
aperture, and with four or five round teeth upon the inner white surface
of the thickened outer lip. It ranges in color from pure white to dark
brown and is sometimes banded. The surface may be smooth or rough,
and is sometimes ruffled all over with wrinkled frills. Length one and
a half inches. Its habits and station are much the same as those of
<em class="e000I2">P. lapillus</em>, of which it is possibly a descendant, somewhat modified by
changed environment. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. lima.</em> A less common species, with rounded whorls and channeled
suture, and about fifteen spiral grooves upon the whorls. The color is
light brown; the length from one quarter of an inch to one inch.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. saxicola.</em> A shell exceedingly abundant along the whole Californian
coast, living under quite the same conditions as the purpuras
already described. It is smaller than the last two, being always less
than an inch in length. It also runs through the gamut of variations as
to color-scheme and sculpturing, but always preserves a certain individuality.
There is a tendency to a small umbilicus; the outer lip is
sharp; the columella is flattened and slightly twisted; and anterior canal
is short, and bears to the left. A smaller aperture, with relatively thicker
shell, seems to be all that distinguishes it from the smaller varieties
of the east-coast species. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Monoceras</em></p>

<p>This genus, which is very closely allied to <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>, is almost
wholly confined to the west coast of the United States. The
name is given on account of a peculiarity, which has, however,
already been noticed in <em class="e000I2">Cerostoma</em>, namely, a horn-like projection
from the basal portion of the outer lip. In all other respects
this genus is nothing but a true <em class="e000I2">Purpura</em>. <a id="pg388"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg388]</span></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. lapilloides.</em> The shell in this species is about an inch in length,
and has markings which give it a striking resemblance to granite. A
row of small round denticles upon the inner surface of the lip is a characteristic
already noticed in some of the west-coast murices. Their station
is the same as that of the purpuras—between the tides on rocky,
exposed shores. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. engonatum.</em> This species has sharply ridged whorls, and revolving
ribs with wavy growth-lines between them. In other respects
it is almost identical with the last described. It is often found mingled
with the seaweed which covers rocks between tides, and, when moist,
simulates the color of its surroundings. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Chorus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. belcheri.</em> This family cannot well be left without at least a
mention of this large and rather handsome species. <em class="e000I2">Chorus</em> is a genus
of but few species, confined to the Pacific shores of North and South
America. This particular species does not reach as far north as San
Francisco, but may be taken at low tide in the vicinity of San Diego.
The prominent feature of the shell is the posterior canal, which, being
abandoned as the growth of the shell continues, leaves a series of hollow,
folded spiny processes upon the shoulder of the body-whorl, which
appear like jagged points upon the spire. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIII">Plate LXXIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">COLUMBELLIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This is a large family of small but often exceedingly beautiful
shells. Their distribution is mostly tropical, but the list of
North American species is a very generous one indeed if the
deeper-water forms are included. The animal is quite the same as
in the <em class="e000I2">Buccinidæ</em>, to be described later.
(See also description of <em class="e000I2">Buccinum undatum</em>
on <a href="#pg330">page 330</a>.) The shells are usually quite
solid, with a long, narrow slit for an aperture; the outer lip is
thickened on the inside, especially about the middle portion, and
is deeply toothed; and the lower portion of the columellar lip is
also ribbed or toothed.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. mercatoria.</em> This Antillean species is found in Florida, and is
one of the gems among the American shallow-water shells. Its height
is about one half of an inch. It is decorated with revolving grooves
and with a variously patterned color-scheme of broken yellow or reddish

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. (Anachis) avara</em>, and the variety <em class="eB00I2">C. similis</em>. These rather
slender shells, about one half to three fifths of an inch long, occur from
Florida northward to Cape Cod. The upper whorls are smooth, the
lower ones are undulated with vertical costæ (ten to thirteen), and the
body-whorl is encircled below the middle by a series of revolving, closely
set grooves. The aperture is typical of the genus, though less strongly
marked by internal callosity on the outer lip and with less prominent
teeth than in <em class="e000I2">C. mercatoria</em>. The greater development of the revolving
grooves, which spread over the entire surface of the body-whorl and
cross the costæ, producing a granulated surface, constitutes the variety
<em class="e000I2">C. similis</em>. The color is brownish, with white reticulations. This species
is to be found in considerable abundance in sandy mud and among
stones and algæ about low-water mark. At New Bedford and Martha's
Vineyard, and on Cape Cod, it may always be taken. It is also common
at Norfolk and along the Virginia and Georgia coasts.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. (Astyris) lunata.</em> One of the characteristic eastern-coast shells,
which, like the last species, ranges from Cape Ann in Massachusetts to
the West Indies. It occurs about low-tide mark and just below, upon
stones and algæ, or crawling about on a soft bottom. On account of its
generic features, combined with the peculiar coloration, the species cannot
be mistaken. The latter is a ground of reddish-brown or fawn, with
encircling rows of large white or yellowish spots. The whorls are quite
smooth. Length not over one fifth of an inch.</p>

<p>The collector soon learns to recognize the variable forms of these
northern-range columbellas. They are not a difficult group, for once
their generic position is established by the characters of the aperture
(which are constant) the species can readily be determined, notwithstanding
their tendencies to vary from the type. Californian waters also
have several columbellas. The conchologists of the west coast have
preferred to apply to their shells, and indeed to employ in general use,
a large number of subgeneric names in place of the ordinarily accepted
generic ones. The result of this is to confuse at first the student of
conchology, who, though fairly familiar with the molluscan genera, finds
himself perplexed when he confronts a list of west-coast shells. Thus
the two common Californian columbellas are <em class="e000I2">"Amphissa" corrugata</em> and
<em class="e000I2">"Astyris" gausapata</em>, these two species belonging to different subgenera
of the genus <em class="e000I2">Columbella</em>.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. corrugata.</em> This shell finds its metropolis in Puget Sound, but
occurs also along the Californian shore. The aperture is wider than is
usual in this genus. The surface is deeply wrinkled by longitudinal
costæ and is encircled by revolving grooves. Length one half of an
inch; color red, or orange to light brown. It is found in shallow protected
waters. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIV">Plate LXXIV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. gausapata.</em> This species lives in great numbers about the roots
of eel-grass. It is very small and smooth, with a rather high spire. The
color of the spire is deep brown; the body-whorl is lighter in color. Occasionally
the body-whorl is obtusely carinated just below the suture.
This little shell is very common upon many beaches after heavy winds,
but it should be sought for at very low tides and gathered alive. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIV">Plate LXXIV.</a>) <a id="pg390"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg390]</span></p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em
class="eBU003">NASSIDÆ</em></p>

<p>These are familiar, and often very characteristic, littoral
shells in all parts of the world. Where they exist at all they are
generally to be found in astonishingly large numbers, sometimes
even crowding out all other mollusks. They are exceedingly active
and predaceous, feeding upon other mollusks, whose shells they bore
through by means of the sharp teeth upon their lingual ribbon. The
<em class="e000I2">Nassidæ</em> of the east coast find a relentless
enemy in the small hermit-crabs, which attack them, drag them
from their coverings, and then proceed to occupy the empty shells
themselves; the torn and lacerated <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>
animal is thereupon leisurely eaten, a retribution probably
well deserved. The animal of <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em> (the
principal genus of <em class="e000I2">Nassidæ</em>) is peculiar in
having frequently a bifurcated tail; or, to speak more correctly,
the posterior end of the foot is terminated by two appendices. It
has a long siphon, and eyes placed upon the outer sides and near
the base of the tentacles. The operculum has serrated edges.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. trivittata</em>, <em class="eB00I2">N. obsoleta</em>. These are the two nassas of the New
England and New Jersey coasts. The first has a more northerly range,
extending to the Gulf of
St. Lawrence; the other is
not usually found north
of Cape Cod, but below
that point as far as Hatteras
it is probably the
commonest shell of the
coast. It fairly swarms in
sheltered muddy reaches
about low tide. Little pools left by the tide on the Jersey
flats are sometimes so crowded with <em class="e000I2">N. obsoleta</em> that for lack
of room the animals crawl over one another. <em class="e000I2">N. trivittata</em> is
more commonly taken at small depths in the harbors, where
it seems to live well upon all kinds of sea-bottom. Probably
they exist in great numbers along the southern shore of Long
Island, for the beaches are often lined with their dead and
worn shells. Over half the specimens thus found will have a
little round perforation upon some whorl, showing that they
were victims of some cannibalistic brother. The shells of the
<em class="e000I2">Nassidæ</em> have a short, ovate aperture, with a short anterior canal. The
inner lip is smooth, and is usually coated over with a more or less heavy
<a id="pg391"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg391]</span> deposit of enamel. <em class="e000I2">N. trivittata</em> is about one half to seven tenths of an
inch long, and is yellowish-white. A series of revolving grooves cutting
across a series of longitudinal lines gives the shell a decussated or
granulated appearance. The whorls are somewhat shouldered
at the sutures, and are white inside. <em class="e000I2">N. obsoleta</em> cannot be
called a handsome shell by the most enthusiastic collector. Its
spire is usually eroded or completely dissolved away. The color
is blackish to olive, with the aperture purplish-black. The
columellar lip is arched, with a twist or fold in its lower portion.
It is decussated by crossing lines and grooves, though not so
conspicuously as <em class="e000I2">N. trivittata</em>; sutures simple; length one half
of an inch to one inch. Old specimens not only become
eroded, but are usually covered with vegetable mould, and
are not over-inspiring to the collector. They often live in brackish
water, and frequent all the inlets and marine flats between Cape Cod
and Hatteras. Below Hatteras both this and the last-named species
occur, though not so plentifully.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. vibex.</em> This ubiquitous little mollusk seems content in any station,
and swarms in all the sandy bays of Florida. It is a busybody, always
on the move, and its long siphon is constantly vibrating. The shell is
about one half an inch long and shining white, with brown or
reddish spots. There are prominent longitudinal undulations
and revolving lines upon the lower part of the body-whorl.
The anterior canal is deeply cut and very short; the columellar
lip arched, richly calloused, and often granulated at its
base. This is probably the first live shell the collector in Florida
will encounter. The animal is very graceful and prettily
marked in color. The terminal cirri on the foot form a

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">N. fossata</em>, <em class="eB00I2">N. perpinguis</em>. On the California coast there are the

<em class="e000I2">N. perpinguis</em>, also <em class="eB00I2">N. tegula</em> and <em class="eB00I2">N. mendica</em>. <em class="e000I2">N. fossata</em> grows to a
length of one and a half to two inches. When adult the lip is somewhat
thickened, and the entire aperture is bright orange. The color of
the shell is ashen-gray, and it is marked with spiral and transverse riblets
which produce a granulated surface, especially upon the upper whorls.
The shell is ribbed inside the mouth. A deep groove circles the anterior
canal at the base of the body-whorl. <em class="e000I2">N. perpinguis</em> is an especially
graceful shell, smaller than the last-named and more finely decussated
and darker (brown) in color. It also has a deeply channeled groove
encircling the base of the body-whorl. It is often banded in chestnut.
Both these species occur in the southern part of California only; <em class="e000I2">N.

<p>From the number of subfamilies and genera included in this

seem that it has served as a sort of dumping-ground for various

the family has recently been reduced by the removal of several
large families, it still remains a bulky one.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Buccinum</em></p>

<p>The animal is described at some length on <a href="#pg330">page 330</a>. It has
no striking peculiarities. The siphon in <em class="e000I2">Buccinum</em> is fairly long;
the eyes are placed about midway between the base and the end
of the tentacles. It is in general a conventional prosobranch animal.
The great majority of the members of this family have a
boreal range and are found widely distributed within the colder
waters of the world.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. undatum.</em> This is the most prominent
representative of the <em class="e000I2">Buccinidæ</em> upon the
North Atlantic shores of the United States. It is an exceedingly
common shell, ranging from Cape Cod to Greenland. It is also found
in England and Scotland, where it is extensively used as food under
the familiar name of "whelk." It affects every kind of station and
seems to be as much at home in very considerable depths as about
the low-tide mark. Upon the Maine coast it may be found almost
everywhere, just below low tide. If none are in sight they may be
attracted by putting a dead fish in a basket and anchoring it near
shore. The American whelk is somewhat smaller than the British
variety, although it attains a length of full three inches. It has
revolving ribs and longitudinal oblique folds. A yellowish-brown,
velvety epidermis covers the entire shell. The lip is simple,
and the shell is white or golden yellow within. The columella
is somewhat twisted; the operculum is corneous, with a lateral
nucleus. The variations in this shell are so great as to have
caused naturalists no little perplexity. Specimens taken near large
cities are apt to be defective. (<a href="#Plate-I">Plate I.</a>)</p></div>

plain, but somewhat modified by the termination of the ribs. The
columella is arched above; the canal produced (sometimes to the
left). The color without is dull ashen-white to horn; within, pure
white. The operculum is small, with a terminal nucleus. The animal

it ranges to Newfoundland, but it has enjoyed the reputation of
being a rare shell and has been greatly prized by local collectors

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. carica.</em> The largest univalve
north of Hatteras, most easily recognized
by its pear-shaped shell, with
simple suture and brilliant vermilion
aperture. The anterior canal is long
and open; the columellar lip is
twisted and arched, and the outer
lip is simple. There is a revolving
row of nodes or spines of various degrees of
prominence upon the shoulder of the body-whorl,
continued on the spiral whorls just above the
suture. The color varies from ashen-gray to a
dirty brown. In young specimens there are
stripes and bands of violaceous brown, and the
shells are striate within the aperture. The length
of this shell is sometimes nine inches.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. carica</em> frequents almost any sort of bottom.
In Long Island Sound they are common on stony
ground, but they do not attain the maximum size and the high degree of
aperture-coloration characteristic of those taken along the New Jersey
shore, on sandy stations exposed to the surf. The string of curiously
shaped capsules containing the eggs of <em class="e000I2">Fulgur</em> is shown in Plate I.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. canaliculata</em> often occurs associated with the last. It does not
attain quite the same size, but specimens of both species are, on the
<a id="pg396"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg396]</span> average, about equal in cubic capacity. It is pear-shaped, like <em class="e000I2">F. carica</em>,
and has a long anterior canal; but its distinguishing features are the
flattened shoulder of the whorls and the deeply channeled sutures. The
epidermis is brown, thick, and heavy. The color of the shell is whitish-gray,
yellowish within. It is found in the same places as <em class="e000I2">F. carica</em>, and
is very abundant at Atlantic City and along the entire New Jersey
coast.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. perversa.</em> A Floridian species, immediately recognizable by the
fact that it is sinistral; otherwise a description of the shell would almost
fit that of <em class="e000I2">F. carica</em>, except in the matter of the color of the aperture,
which in <em class="e000I2">F. perversa</em> is brownish-white. The brownish streaks upon the
whorls, in young specimens, are a very noticeable feature of this shell.
The shoulders of the whorls are rather flatter than in <em class="e000I2">F. carica</em>, but,
unlike <em class="e000I2">F. canaliculata</em>, the sutures are simple. The row of nodes or
rounded spines which encircles the body-whorl appears in the spire as
nodes just above the sutures. The animal is jet-black, and frequents
sandy flats, where, at low tide, it may be gathered in considerable numbers,
as it plows its way along, almost wholly concealed beneath the sand.
Large specimens measure quite a foot in length. In old shells the
color-markings are not so brilliant, the shells being a dull, lusterless
white. (<a href="#Plate-LXXV">Plate LXXV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. pyrum.</em> Another Floridian species, much smaller than the last
(three to four inches), with a regular, pear-shaped outline, a long anterior
canal, a low spire, deeply channeled sutures, flattened shoulders, and
no spinous or nodose processes. It is ornamented with revolving inconspicuous
ribs or striæ, alternately larger, and has a somewhat hirsute
epidermis. The color is white, with transverse broad yellowish or rusty
lines; the color within the aperture resembles that of the exterior color-lines.
It is found on sandy stations, in shallow water. (<a href="#Plate-LXXV">Plate LXXV.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Melongena</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. corona.</em> A Floridian species, named from the single or double row
of spinous processes upon the shoulder of the body-whorl and the crenulated
appearance of the spire caused by the continuations of the triangular
spines. The three apical whorls are not spinous. There is also a
row of hollow triangular spines obliquely encircling the base of the shell.
The epidermis is heavy, rough, and brown; the aperture oval and large;
the outer lip notched at points where the spines commence; the anterior
canal wide and short; and the columella white and twisted, and banded
within with purplish-chestnut and white. The color without is drab in
older specimens, in young specimens chestnut banded with revolving
striæ. Length four inches. Found in shallow water. This active predaceous
animal must be the terror of the mollusks in Florida. With his
sharply toothed radula he is able to pierce even the ponderous clam-shell,
<em class="e000I2">Venus mercenaria</em>, variety <em class="e000I2">mortoni</em>, and devour the soft fleshy parts
within. No mollusk, save, perhaps, the vigorous <em class="e000I2">Strombus pugilis</em>, can
escape the attack of this highwayman. (<a href="#Plate-LXXV">Plate LXXV.</a>)</p></div>

<em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">FASCIOLARIIDÆ</em></p>

<p>This family comprises a number of genera of mollusks which
have a fusiform shell, with a long-drawn-out spire and a long
anterior canal. The animal is in no manner remarkable; no
essential differences are to be noted from the usual conventional
type of gasteropod mollusk, represented in the two families last
described.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em>
 <em class="eB00I2">Fasciolaria</em></p>

<p>This genus is of tropical range, and contains many species of
shells which are more or less conspicuous for their large size or
their beauty of form. Three species occur in Floridian waters, and
all of them may be taken about low-tide mark on the sandy flats
which are so characteristic of Florida bays and harbors. All of
them are sluggish animals which crawl very slowly along the
bottom or bury themselves almost wholly in the sand, leaving only
the tip of the spire projecting slightly above.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. gigantea.</em> This is said to be the largest gasteropod shell known. It
often attains a length of sixteen inches, and specimens are reported to
have been found measuring no less than two feet. This huge mollusk
has a symmetrically fusiform shell, with whorls obtusely ridged and
armed with large rounded nodes. The aperture is reddish-brown within.
The anterior canal is long and open, and there are three "plaits," or
folds, about the columella. The outer lip is more or less sinuate, the color
is fleshy-white, and the shell is covered with a thick yellowish or chestnut
epidermis. The animal is of a brilliant scarlet color. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVI">Plate LXXVI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. tulipa.</em> An exceedingly common species of Floridian waters, which
may justly be classed among the "show shells" of the American Atlantic
fauna. It has a typically symmetrical, fusiform shape, with gracefully
rounded whorls, and is spirally but not deeply grooved. The sutures are
crenulated; the anterior canal is long; there are three entering folds
upon the columella; and the outer lip is simple. The scheme of coloration
is variable, but there are two chief patterns, which are usually followed,
though they often are considerably modified. One is a light-bluish body,
variegated with chestnut or olive blotches, which are more extensive
upon the spire than upon the body-whorl; the other is a pinkish body,
encircled with revolving black lines. The specimens of <em class="e000I2">F. tulipa</em>, which
are found so abundantly in the shallow bays and estuaries of the Florida
coast, are, for some reason, never brightly colored, as are those taken in
the open sea. The length is about four to six inches. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVI">Plate LXXVI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">F. distans.</em> A form almost identical with that last described. It is
much smaller, varying from two to three inches in length, lacks the crenulations
of the sutures, and is perfectly smooth, save for a few spiral
ridges about the base. The color is bluish-white, with clouded longitudinal
<a id="pg398"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg398]</span> streaks of olive. Encircling the shell are from four to seven black
lines. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVI">Plate LXXVI.</a>)</p>

<p>These three species of <em class="e000I2">Fasciolaria</em> often occur associated upon sand-banks
which are exposed at unusually low tides. It requires some force
to dislodge the large <em class="e000I2">F. gigantea</em> from its bed of sand. When the apex
is discovered projecting an inch or less from the bottom, the collector
must scrape away the sand down to the body-whorl, and then secure a
good hold upon the spire and pull hard. The stupid animal will not at
once withdraw into his shell, but will hang protruded from the aperture
like a great piece of vividly red meat. To extract any of these larger
fasciolarias from its shell, it is necessary to boil it for ten or fifteen minutes.
Large specimens of <em class="e000I2">F. gigantea</em> should remain in the pot half an
hour. The heavy corneous epidermis of <em class="e000I2">F. gigantea</em> will dry and crumble
away unless it is rubbed with vaseline about once a year.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">VOLUTIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Voluta</em></p>

 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Voluta junonia.</em></div>
</div>

<p>The <em class="eB0002">Volutidæ</em>, like the cowries, are "aristocratic"
shells. As was stated above,
there are many collectors who have become
so fascinated by the shells of a few
of these "first families of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>" that
they make great efforts and spend no small
sums in seeking to complete their cabinet
series of the rare and more beautiful forms.
The <em class="e000I2">Volutidæ</em> certainly have very beautiful
shells, and they are for the most part
exceedingly rare. The reason of their
rarity has no doubt something to do with
their habits. They are probably largely
dwellers upon rocky ground, where the
dredge cannot reach them. There is but
one species of <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em> upon the American
coasts which is available to the shore-collector,
and this is the well-known and
much-sought-after <em class="eB00I2">V. junonia</em>. The animal
of <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em> has a very broad foot, and
a head curiously divided into two lobes,
upon which are placed sessile eyes. A remarkable feature of the
genus is the lack of an operculum. <a id="pg399"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg399]</span></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">V. junonia.</em> This volute has never been taken alive in shallow water
near the shore, but is occasionally found cast upon the beach after violent
storms. Sanibel Island is the best locality. <em class="e000I2">V. junonia</em> has an
obtuse apex, a long aperture, and a shell from three to three and a half
inches in length. The color is cream-white, painted with rows of large
deep-red spots. In his "American Marine Shells," published nearly
thirty years ago, Mr. Tryon says: "This is the most rare and valuable
American marine shell; specimens in good condition sell for from fifty to
one hundred dollars." A good specimen is probably not worth so much
to-day as when Mr. Tryon wrote, but it is at least worth a careful survey
of a Floridian beach after a storm.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">MARGINELLIDÆ</em></p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Marginella</em></p>

<p>This is a family of exquisite little shells. In point of beauty
they would rival the volutes were they not so much handicapped
by their small size. The largest <em class="e000I2">Marginella</em> is not more than an
inch and a half in length, while the great majority of its two hundred
tropical species do not exceed one half an inch. The animal
is very similar to that of <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em>; indeed, the marginellas were
until recently included in the <em class="e000I2">Volutidæ</em>. The shell is also suggestive
of <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em>. It is porcelanous, highly polished, and shining
like all shells which are covered by a portion of the mantle
when the animal is extended. Forty-seven species of <em class="e000I2">Marginella</em>
are recorded from the Atlantic coast of the United States. The
marginellas frequent sandy or muddy sheltered spots, and may be
collected between tide-marks. In California there are several
species, which are so minute that it seems hardly worth while to
attempt a description of them. They are white and very inconspicuous
little shells. One is tempted, however, to speak of some
of the fine marginellas of the Bahamas. The animals are quite
as beautifully marked as the shells themselves, while the shell of
one species is used in jewelry on account of its pearly luster suffused
with the most delicate pink.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. apicina.</em> The most abundant Floridian species of this genus.
It is not more than one third of an inch long, with a depressed spire, a
large body-whorl, a long aperture nearly equaling the entire length of
the shell, a thickened outer lip, and four very prominent plaits on the
columella. The surface is smooth. The white, enlarged outer lip is
glazed or highly polished, and bluish or brown in color, with red spots.

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Oliva</em></p>

<p>The genus <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em> is one of the favorites among collectors. It
comprises smooth, highly polished, porcelanous, and oval shells
with a deeply notched, long, narrow aperture. The columellar lip is
usually heavily calloused and ornamented with oblique folds. The
animal's foot is very large, and extends laterally into lobes which
curve back over the shell. In front the propodium is very large,
forming, as in <em class="e000I2">Natica</em> and <em class="e000I2">Polynices</em>, a sort of plow. The mantle
lobes almost cover the shell when extended.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. literata.</em> The only American example out of some sixty known
species. It is found in great abundance in sandy tide-pools along the west
Florida shores. It ranges from Hatteras to the West Indies, and
may be looked for in stations similar to those of the naticas. It is exceedingly
active, crawling rapidly over the sand or burying itself very
quickly out of sight, and is carnivorous. The shell is highly polished,
about two inches long, and pale yellowish-white in color, covered with
longitudinal, angulated, or zigzag lines of chestnut. The spire is short,
the sutures channeled, and the columella calloused with white enamel,
and obliquely striated. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVII">Plate LXXVII.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Olivella</em></p>

<p>The genus <em class="e000I2">Olivella</em> resembles <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em> very closely in conchological
characters, but the shells are, with few exceptions, exceedingly
small, and usually have a somewhat more elongated spire
than is the case in the genus <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em> proper. The animal of <em class="e000I2">Olivella</em>
seems to be a degenerate, for it possesses neither tentacles
nor eyes. In habit and station it resembles <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em>.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. mutica.</em> In Floridian waters this species is exceedingly common.
It is not more than one fifth of an inch long, is highly polished and shining,
and yellowish-white in color, with revolving pale rufous bands. It
has the typical oliva-shape.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. biplicata.</em> A Californian species of considerable interest, the
largest of the olivellas. It was evidently used by the aborigines as
wampum or as ornaments, for a great many specimens are found among
buried Indian relics. This species is about the size and shape of an
olive. The spire is short, though longer than the typical <em class="e000I2">Oliva</em> spire, the
shell is smooth and highly polished, and the columella is thickly calloused,
and has two entering folds near the base. The color is creamy-white
to dove-color, with a purple sheen over all, and purple markings
<a id="pg401"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg401]</span>  about the base. Professor Keep speaks of the vast numbers of these
olivellas on sandy stations along the Pacific coast. Having found a place
where a "little stream of water was oozing out from the bank of sand,"
he proceeded to dig with a hoe. "I found them [<em class="e000I2">O. biplicata</em>] by the
hundreds," he continues, "and I had gathered about a thousand before
the tide came in. They seemed to lie in groups just under the surface
of the sand, yet wholly concealed from sight." (<a href="#Plate-LXXVII">Plate LXXVII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. boetica.</em> A much smaller Pacific form, with a higher tapering
spire. It is brown to bluish in color, and often has yellowish stripes. It
is polished and shining. Found in sandy stations.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Conus</em></p>

<p>This is a comprehensive family of several highly diversified
genera. Its most prominent genus is <em class="e000I2">Conus</em>, a name which indicates
the principal feature of the shell, for it is almost an exact
cone in shape. <em class="e000I2">Conus</em>, along with <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em> and <em class="e000I2">Cypræa</em>, is entitled
to the honor of being considered an aristocrat among mollusks.
There are about three hundred and fifty species known, mostly
tropical and Indo-Pacific in distribution. The shells have many
points of beauty and are often of very high coloration and eccentric
markings. Some of the rarer forms are famous in conchological
annals for the enormous prices which they have
commanded. The rare and beautiful <em class="e000I2">Conus gloria-maris</em> once
brought £43 ($215) at an auction sale in London. In all shells of
<em class="e000I2">Conus</em> there is a notch at the upper edge of the aperture for the
accommodation of a posterior canal. In some other genera of
this family this notch becomes a more prominent feature. The
animal has a well-developed foot, a retractile proboscis, eyes
situated upon the tentacles, and a fairly long siphon. Upon the
under surface of the foot is a conspicuous pore, which opens into
a water-vascular system of the foot. <em class="e000I2">Conus</em> is accused of having a
poison-gland connected with the radula and of having shown
vicious traits when captured. The animals are shy, and remain
most of the time in hiding, while their pretty shells during life
are generally rendered obscure by a dull, colorless epidermis.
There are but few species of <em class="e000I2">Conus</em> upon the Atlantic shores of
the United States, and these are confined to the warmer waters
of Florida and the Gulf of Mexico. <a id="pg402"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg402]</span></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. floridanus.</em> A not unusual shell in shallow-water stations
throughout the Florida coast. It has almost the exact outlines of a cone.
The flattened shoulder is marked off by an acute carina; the spire is low,
but many-whorled and pagoda-like; the aperture is long and narrow,
and the lip is simple. The coloring is yellowish, banded on a creamy-white
background, or dotted in circular rows. Length two inches.
(<a href="#Plate-LXXVII">Plate LXXVII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. pealii.</em> One of the smallest species of this genus, its length never
exceeding one half of an inch, whereas the majority of the cones are over
two inches in length, and many of them rank as large shells. This little
Floridian species is regularly cone-shaped, with carinated whorls, thin
outer lip, and pagoda-like, low spire. The color is reddish-brown with
sky-blue spots, or bluish-brown with lighter spots. There are encircling
grooves about the base of the shell.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Cancellaria</em></p>

<p>The last family of the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em> to be considered is the <em class="e000I2">Cancellariidæ</em>,
which has but one genus, <em class="eB00I2">Cancellaria</em>. There are several
species upon the east coast belonging to deeper-water zones, but
one well-known species, <em class="eB00I2">C. reticulata</em>, is very common on shore
stations from Hatteras south. The shell is oblong and solid,
with a moderate spire, and whorls slightly flattened below the
sutures, and is very roughly granulated or reticulated. The
aperture is narrowly ovate, and is ribbed inside. The columella
has two very strong and prominent plaits. The color is white,
banded and variegated with reddish-brown. Length an inch or
more. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVII">Plate LXXVII.</a>)</p>

 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Entalis striolata.</em></div>
</div>

<p>In nearly all collections of shells from the northeast coast
of the United States are certain specimens about one to one and
a half inches long, pure white, and shaped very much like an
elephant's tusk. They are round, hollow tubes, slightly curved,
of larger diameter at one end than at the other, and with an
opening at either end. There are two very common species of these
tooth shells upon the New England coast, <a id="pg403"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg403]</span> <em class="eB00I2">Dentalium
dentale</em> and <em class="eB00I2">Entalis striolata</em>. The
first has a simple round hole at the smaller end of the shell, and
is faintly marked by longitudinal striæ; the other is a smooth
shell which has a notch-like fissure on the margin of the apical
perforation. Neither of these species is, strictly speaking, a
littoral form, for all the <em class="e000I2">Dentalidæ</em> range
into deep water, many of them living only in the profounder depths
of the ocean. But these two species are exceedingly common in
the New England coastal waters, at very moderate depths, and may
sometimes be found upon the beach cast up by storms. They live
buried in the mud, and feed upon infusorians and all manner of
microscopic organisms.</p>

<p>Upon the west coast <em class="eB00I2">Dentalium pretiosum</em>
is very abundant north of California. It is almost like the
east-coast <em class="e000I2">Dentalium</em>, but is more slender.
The Indians used to gather these shells and string them together
upon long threads to be carried about and used as money. In
California occurs <em class="eB00I2">Dentalium hexagonum</em>, a
very delicate little species with a slightly angulated shell.</p>

</div>

<p>The animal of the <em class="e000I2">Dentalidæ</em> is
remarkable, and easily merits the rank of a separate molluscan
class. It has no head, no tentacles, no eyes, no heart, and
no gills. It is a mollusk because it has a mantle, a foot,
and a radula. Its position, therefore, is between the <em
class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, which it resembles in its univalve
shell and radula, and the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>,
to which it is related by the pointed foot and the absence of
head and tentacles, and also by the symmetry which pervades its
organization.</p>

<p>Upon either side of the mouth, just beneath the flap of the
mantle, are bunches of ciliated, contractile filaments (<em class="e000I2">captacula</em>),
flattened at the end, which are supposed to be breathing-organs,
and are perhaps exserted for the purpose of catching food. <a id="pg404"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg404]</span></p>

<p>The entire absence of such important organs as the heart and
gills, together with the fact that they are undoubted mollusks,
would indicate that the <em class="e000I2">Scaphopoda</em> are very degenerate animals.
The circulatory and respiratory system of mollusks is typically
of a high order.</p>

<p>A great many specimens of the <em class="e000I2">Dentalidæ</em> dredged in New
England waters are dead shells, occupied by a worm which seals
up the larger opening, leaving only a small aperture through
which it protrudes its long white body. These must not mislead
the collector into a vain search for a mantle and other molluscan
characteristics of anatomy.</p>

<p>Some of the larger species of <em class="e000I2">Dentalium</em> from deep-sea stations
are four to five inches in length. <a id="pg405"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg405]</span></p>

<h4 title="Class Pelecypoda"><a id="pg409"></a>CLASS <em class="eBU001">PELECYPODA</em></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>This is a large and important class of the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em>, comprising
an extensive group of animals, which vary widely in
structure. Next to the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, it is the largest class of the
phylum in number of genera and species. The name indicates a
"hatchet-shaped" foot, but in many cases it is a misnomer.
<em class="e000I2">Acephala</em>, meaning "without a head," is also employed for this
class, and is, perhaps, a better term. <em class="e000I2">Lamellibranchiata</em>, referring
to the type of gills prevalent throughout the division, is another
name often used. The popular name "bivalves" is an altogether
correct one, for all the animals of this class have two shells. To
the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em> belong the oysters, clams, scallops, mussels, and,
in short, all the <em class="e000I2">bivalve</em> mollusks (the word "valve" meaning
"shell"). The organization of a pelecypod is entirely similar to
that of a gasteropod or a chiton in its fundamental or essential
plan, but it differs widely from both in matters of detail. If the
student will keep in mind the general principles of gasteropod or
the amphineuran structure when he dissects his first pelecypod, he
will quickly see that the latter is about the same as a chiton would
be were it folded over from a longitudinal median line as axis
along its back, so that the opposite mantle-edges would meet, and
its various shell-plates would unite upon either side into a single
valve; or it is very like a gasteropod made symmetrical, and covered
upon its two sides by separate shells instead of covered over
its top by one shell. The loss of head, eyes, and tentacles, the
substitution of labial palps, the extension and greater development
of the gills, the modification of the foot and mantle, and the
presence of certain special glands in the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em> become mere
matters of anatomical detail. <a id="pg410"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg410]</span></p>

<p>Any large clam will serve for dissection. In the neighborhood
of New York the edible species known as the "Little Neck" clam
(<em class="e000I2">Venus mercenaria</em>), or the larger <em class="e000I2">Mactra</em> of the sandy shores, will
answer the purpose very well. In Florida, <em class="e000I2">Callista</em>, <em class="e000I2">Venus</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em>
are all available. On the west coast the large, heavy <em class="e000I2">Tivela
crassatelloides</em> is probably the best subject. The oyster (<em class="e000I2">Ostrea</em>)
is a degenerate type; and the scallops (<em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>) and the mussels
(<em class="e000I2">Mytilus</em> and <em class="e000I2">Modiola</em>) have certain special modifications of their
organs which might prove confusing, so these genera are not
recommended for dissection and study at first.</p>

<p>Boiling is apt to shrivel and distort the soft, fleshy animal of
the bivalves, and it is far better to examine a fresh specimen.
The surest way of opening a clam without injuring the animal is
to break one of the shells by sharp taps of a hammer, using great
care not to lacerate the body within by a too vigorous assault.
Pick off the broken pieces after having separated them carefully
with a knife from the mantle margin, to which they cling, and
after having cut through the tough adductor muscles as close to
the shell as possible. The subject for anatomical study is then prepared
"upon the half-shell."</p>

<h5>THE MANTLE</h5>

<p>The mantle is generally very thin, often a fleshy film of the
finest tissue, and adheres to the inner side of each valve. The
outer rim of the mantle is thickened and free, i.e., is not attached
to the shell. This free portion is capable of slight extension
beyond the margin of the shell when the valves are opened and the
animal is off guard. In many genera the mantle edge is highly
ornate, being waved, crenulated, or fluted, or is beset with several
rows of papillæ, and is often richly colored. Mr. Hickson, a naturalist,
who traveled in Celebes, says that the brilliant coloring
of the mantle margins of mollusks contributed largely to the
extraordinary color-effects upon the coral reefs.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the mantle entirely incloses the animal at
the back and sides, just as the cover of a book incloses the pages
or printed portion. At the posterior end of the animal there is
usually a point—or perhaps two points—at which the flaps of <a id="pg411"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg411]</span>
the mantle lobes unite in order to form two openings. These
openings are called the siphons.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 579px;">

 long tubular siphons: <em class="e000I2">A</em>, excurrent siphon;
 <em class="e000I2">B</em>, incurrent siphon.</div>
</div>

<h5>SIPHONS</h5>

<p>In some cases the mantle lobes do not actually unite to form
regular siphonal openings, but in life the free mantle-edges have
a way of adjusting themselves posteriorly to form <em class="e000I2">functional
siphons</em> without actually coalescing. Usually, however, the mantle
flaps not only unite posteriorly to form true siphons, but are
capable at that point of varying degrees of protrusion from the
shell, and when extended the siphons appear as two tubes. In
some genera these siphonal tubes are very long; in others they
are fastened together and surrounded by a tough, leathery integument, <a id="pg412"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg412]</span>
which, like the siphons proper, is only an extended portion
of the mantle-edge. The orifices of the siphons are generally
papillaceous. These two siphons (for there are always two if
there are any at all) are the <em class="e000I2">anal</em> or excurrent (upper) and the
<em class="e000I2">branchial</em> or incurrent siphon. The function of the latter is to
draw in the pure water to bathe the gills and to furnish food,
while the office of the former is to eject waste materials and the
water which has already passed over the gills.</p>

</div>

<h5>MANTLE FUSION</h5>

<p>Besides the points of juncture where the mantle-edges unite
to form the siphons, the coalescence of the two mantle lobes may
be extended, and they may become further united and fused together
at other points. Indeed, the fusion of the mantle-edges may
become almost complete; but it always leaves the siphonal openings
and a third opening through which the foot may be extended.
This opening for the foot is called the <em class="e000I2">pedal opening</em>, or orifice.
In such cases, therefore, the mantle becomes much like a bag or
sac. The degree of fusion of the mantle-edges appears to correspond
closely with certain changes in the organization of the animal,
and this feature must be regarded as a very important
character. <a id="pg413"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg413]</span></p>

<p>The figures on <a href="#pg411">pages 411</a>,
 <a href="#pg412">412</a>, and <a href="#pg413">413</a>
show the degrees of mantle
fusion in various groups from the open to the almost wholly
closed types. One (A, <a href="#pg413">page 413</a>) gives an example of very large
siphons united together and protected by the tough, leathery integument.
To the right of this cut may be seen the foot projecting
from the pedal opening in the mantle. Another gives the
two siphons of <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em>, the lower or branchial one being the
longer. The mantle-edges below are fluted, and a large foot projects
forward. Another shows two siphons of <em class="e000I2">Scrobicularia</em>, of the
free and greatly extended type. Fig. B (<a href="#pg413">page 413</a>) illustrates the
ventral portion of a pelecypod, which shows very well the most
advanced type of mantle fusion.
Besides the siphonal openings
at the end of the long projection
to the left, the only other
opening is the very small orifice
marked "2," for the accommodation
of a small, insignificant
foot. In the other figures different
degrees of mantle fusion
are indicated.</p>

</div>

<p>Before removing the mantle
from one side of the specimen
to be examined, note the two
strong muscles which are at either end of the body. These are
the <em class="e000I2">anterior</em> and <em class="e000I2">posterior adductor</em> muscles, their office being to
hold the valves tightly shut. They are of great strength, as any
one may prove to his satisfaction by attempting to open a clam.
Through a long series of forms these two muscles approach each
other in position, and in the scallops and the oysters there is but
one adductor muscle, occupying a central position. Morphologically
it is the survival of the posterior adductor.</p>

<h5>THE BRANCHIÆ OR GILLS</h5>

<p>Removing carefully the thin, fleshy mantle, the gills are exposed
to view—that is, of course, the gills of that side of the <a id="pg414"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg414]</span>
animal, for there are two sets, one upon each side of the body,
or visceral mass, and lying between the body proper and the
mantle folds. Each set consists of two plate-like bodies with a
texture of reticulated or basketwork appearance. Thus there
are the inner and outer right gills and the inner and outer left
gills. If one gill is removed and carefully examined it will itself
probably be found to be double, consisting of many filaments
placed side by side and then doubled back like a row of hairpins,
the filaments being united by interciliary processes, or by
vascular channels together with more or less dense connective
tissue.</p>

<p>The modifications of the pelecypod gills are difficult to follow,
but the principle upon which they perform their duties is the
same in all cases. The gill-filaments are all connected with a
long vein, and, being hollow, admit the blood, which is aërated by
close contact with the water and is then returned to another vein
in immediate connection with the auricles of the heart. There is
another function accomplished by the gills, which in some families
seems to be quite as important as their respiratory one,
namely, the office of giving lodgment to the ova while in process
of development before hatching. At certain seasons the gills of
a number of pelecypod genera become literally filled with eggs;
sometimes this curious phenomenon extends to the mantle itself,
and more or less to the entire surface of the animal. The eggs
are first regularly ejected from the genital ducts and find lodgment
upon the body-surface, but usually only upon the gills,
where they remain as in a brood-pouch between the lamellæ of
the inner and outer gills. When the eggs hatch, the free-swimming
young escape from the mantle cavity. Probably not more
than one individual in a million ever reaches maturity.</p>

<p>The figure on <a href="#pg408">page 408</a> shows the mantle removed, exhibiting
the gills, the foot, the labial palps, and the pericardium, inside of
which is the heart. Removing the gills, we find exposed the body,
or visceral mass, which, as in the <em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, is thickened below
into the foot. A longitudinal section is shown on <a href="#pg408">page 408</a>, the
visceral mass being sliced almost through the middle; a portion
of the gills of the farther side shows below. <a id="pg415"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg415]</span></p>

<h5>THE FOOT</h5>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 340px;">
 <a id="fig-Mytilus-edulis"></a>
 <img src="images/i523a.jpg" width="340" height="251" alt="" />
 <div class="captionleft"><em class="e000I2">Mytilus edulis</em>,
 attached by its byssus (<em class="e000I2">By</em>) to a piece of
 wood: <em class="e000I2">F</em>, foot; <em class="e000I2">S</em>,
 excurrent siphon, the branchial siphon being below it and not
 closed.</div>
</div>

<p>The foot undergoes great variation, from a strong, powerful
organ capable of forcing its way through heavy gravelly bottom
or burrowing deeply into the sand or mud, to the merest trace of
a pedal organ. In the oyster the foot has become almost entirely
atrophied; the stationary life led by the animal renders such an
organ quite unnecessary. Excepting in a few families, the pelecypod
foot is well developed. In a number of genera the foot contains
a gland for the secretion of long silk-like or horn-like fibers,
which are collectively called a <em class="e000I2">byssus</em>.
The use of a byssus is for attachment to any object to effect a
temporary or permanent lodgment. The accompanying cut shows <em
class="e000I2">Mytilus edulis</em>, a common east-coast pelecypod,
attached by its byssus to a piece of wood. Most bivalves having a
strong byssus exhibit a feeble development of the foot; nearly all
bivalves, however, show traces, sometimes only in the embryo, of a
byssal gland.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 320px;">
 <a id="fig-Pecten-opercularis"></a>
 <img src="images/i523b.jpg" width="320" height="155" alt="" />
 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Pecten
 opercularis</em>, showing the ocelli, or eyes, on the two edges of
 the mantle.</div>
</div>

<p>The visceral mass contains the liver, the exceedingly large
generative glands, the kidneys, etc., and through all this soft
whitish or reddish mass the alimentary canal wanders about in
a tortuous fashion, finally passing through the pericardium
and the ventricle of the heart, and terminating just over and
back of the posterior adductor muscle. <a id="pg416"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg416]</span></p>

<p>The pelecypods have no head or tentacles, but the place of
the latter is taken by two pairs of triangular flaps upon either
side of the mouth. These are called the <em class="e000I2">labial
palps</em>, and they no doubt operate by means of their ciliated
surface to keep in motion the current of water over the gills and
to the mouth.</p>

<p>As a rule, pelecypods have no eyes, but when eyes are present
they are situated upon the edge of the mantle. The eyes are not
highly developed organs, but they nevertheless appear to be very
sensitive to light, for the bivalves which are so endowed will,
when kept in aquaria, instantly close their shells when the shadow
of a fish passes over them.</p>

<p>The heart lies in the pericardium and is situated dorsally, just
in front of the posterior adductor muscle. It has a median ventricle
and two lateral auricles, each connected with the branchiæ
upon its respective side. It seems a curious economy that passes
the intestine through the ventricle, but this is the case in the
great majority of pelecypod genera. The vascular system is closed
and is of a high order. It is probable that "breathing" takes
place upon the inner mantle surfaces as well as in the gills themselves;
for these surfaces are crowded with excessively fine and
delicate capillaries, which bring the blood very near to the water.
This power of "breathing by the skin" is quite characteristic of
the <em class="e000I2">Mollusca</em> in general.</p>

<p>Having once familiarized one's self with the more prominent
features of pelecypod organization, it becomes very interesting
to examine anatomically every new form that is captured. Surprises
are always in store, and sometimes the peculiar juxtaposition
and relative sizes of the organs are a trifle confusing; but,
upon the whole, the bivalve organization is simple and lends
itself far more readily than does that of the gasteropods to satisfactory
examination. Some of the more striking anatomical
peculiarities are reserved for mention in the notes upon the
various genera and species common upon our shores.</p>

<h5>THE PELECYPOD SHELL</h5>

<p>As has been seen, the testaceous covering of the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>
consists of two valves or shells which fit more or less closely and <a id="pg417"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg417]</span>
firmly together and are placed one upon either side of the animal.
The two valves are always held together tightly along a dorsal
margin by a "hinge ligament," an exceedingly tough, leathery
substance, and they are usually secured the more firmly by a
system of interlocking teeth, which project from the hinge. The
opening and shutting of the valves is controlled by the adductor
muscles of the animal, by the
<em class="e000I2">ligament</em> which binds the valves
together, and by the <em class="e000I2">cartilage</em>, an
elastic pad of rubber-like appearance
which is lodged just within
the hinge, and is compressed
when the valves are closed together.
Thus, when the valves
are closed, there is always a strain
upon the adductor to overcome
the elastic resistance of the cartilage.
When a pelecypod dies
and the pull of the adductor muscles
is released, the valves gape
open.</p>

 posterior lateral tooth.</div>
</div>

<p>The summit or apex of the valve is called the <em
class="e000I2">umbo</em>, or <em class="e000I2">beak</em>. It is
usually twisted to some extent, and in certain forms develops a
suggestive spiral figure. The beaks of the valves are the points
where the shell-growth begins, the secretion of calcareous matter
being made by the mantle margin and deposited about the edges
of the valves; the growth is therefore constantly away from the
umbones.</p>

<p>The umbones usually point forward. In many species they
touch each other over the hinge-margin or approximate very
closely; in other species the hinge-margin is very wide and the
beaks are comparatively far apart. The hinge-margin, lying adjacent
to the umbones, is known as the <em class="e000I2">dorsal margin</em> of the shell, in
contradistinction to the <em class="e000I2">ventral margin</em>, opposite the umbones.
The <em class="e000I2">anterior margin</em> is the front edge and the <em class="e000I2">posterior margin</em> the
hinder edge of the shells, through which the siphons may project.</p>

<p>When the umbones are about central in respect to the posterior <a id="pg418"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg418]</span>
and anterior margins, the shells are said to be <em class="e000I2">equilateral</em>. When
the two valves are almost exactly alike in size and shape they are
called <em class="e000I2">equivalve</em>.</p>

<p>In many forms there is a heart-shaped space upon the dorsal
margin of the closed valves forward of the umbones, called the
<em class="e000I2">lunule</em>. Similarly placed back of the umbones is sometimes a
more or less clearly defined space called the <em class="e000I2">escutcheon</em>. The outer
surface of bivalve shells admits of infinite variety of sculpturing
and ornamentation, ranging from a perfectly smooth to a heavily
ribbed, nodose, spinous, or deeply decussated surface. The color-markings
are often brilliant and eccentric.</p>

<p>The right and left valves may be distinguished by remembering
that the siphons are always posterior, and that the umbones
usually point forward.</p>

<p>The hinge of bivalve shells undergoes many variations in the
different genera. The simplest type is a smooth edentate surface
where the two valves meet and are held together only by the
strong ligament. Generally, however, there is a system of interlocking
teeth, those in the center of the hinge being the <em class="e000I2">cardinals</em>
and those upon either side the <em class="e000I2">laterals</em>. In some forms there are
rows of fine comb-like teeth along the hinge-margin, with no distinction
between cardinals and laterals.</p>

<p>The object of these hinge-teeth is at once obvious, for they
give a rigidity and increased strength to the entire mechanism,
especially when closed. There is occasionally a saucer-shaped
plate or platform just under the cardinal teeth and within the
shell, called the <em class="e000I2">fossette</em>. Upon this rests the internal elastic
cartilage.</p>

<p>Upon the smooth interior surfaces of the valves are always certain
markings, which correspond to anatomical features of the
animal and are consequently of considerable importance in the
determination of the systematic position of the specimen. First,
the well-marked impressions left by the adductor muscles will be
noted; then a more or less distinct line which, describing roughly
a circle, connects the two muscle scars. This line represents the
points at which the mantle became detached from the shell. In
other words, all the space within this <em class="e000I2">pallial line</em> (barring the <a id="pg419"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg419]</span>
muscle scars) was, in life, covered by the mantle, which adhered
tightly to it. The space between this pallial line and the outer
edge of the valve was occupied in life by the free portion of the
mantle. Frequently a depression in the pallial line toward the
center of the valve is seen in the posterior end. This is called
the <em class="e000I2">pallial sinus</em>, and marks the space occupied by the siphons.
The pallial sinus is absent, moderate, or deep, according as the
animal possessed no siphons, or small or large ones.</p>

<p>The length of bivalve shells is measured from their anterior to
their posterior ends, while the height indicates the greatest diameter
between the umbones and the ventral margin.</p>

<p>The greatest possible degree of variation exists in the structure
of the pelecypod shell. Every degree of thickness from the most
fragile, tissue-like structure to the very heavy and ponderous
tests of some of the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em> is to be found. There is also a
range in size from the very minute <em class="e000I2">Spheria</em> to the giant <em class="e000I2">Tridacna</em>
of Eastern seas, which weighs several hundred pounds. As in the
<em class="e000I2">Gasteropoda</em>, there is fortunately a very close parallelism between
shell and anatomical variations. One very quickly learns to
place a bivalve in its systematic position by a mere glance at the
shell alone. While the higher classification into orders, suborders,
etc., is based upon anatomical features, the genera often
and the species always are founded upon conchological or shell
characters.</p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em> offer one of the most interesting fields for
investigation and study among the invertebrates. Although by
no means neglected, they have not received as much attention on
the part of biologists as has been given to other phyla, or indeed
to the other classes of this same phylum.</p>

<h5>CLASSIFICATION OF THE PELECYPODA</h5>

<p>Nearly every systematic writer upon the mollusks has attempted
to give a good classification of the bivalves, yet none of the results
is wholly satisfactory. The scheme now generally adopted is
one based upon modifications of the gills, or branchiæ, and has
practically replaced all the older classifications, which depended <a id="pg420"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg420]</span>
upon the presence or absence of siphons, the degree of mantle
fusion, the arrangement of teeth upon the hinge, the number of
adductor muscles, etc. The idea of arrangement according to
gill-structure is substantially this: the development of the gill
from the simplest and most rudimentary type through successive
stages to a higher, more complex, and presumably more efficient
type, marks the natural progress or development of the
pelecypod animal itself. By adopting the gill as a guide one
follows, therefore, a natural method. Upon the other hand, the
presence or absence of siphons, the shape of the foot, the number
of adductor muscles, all depend merely upon the acquired habits
of the animal, these particular features being subject to modification
according to environment and changed conditions.</p>

<p>The five orders of the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>
are: <em class="e000I2">Protobranchiata</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Filibranchiata</em>, <em
class="e000I2">Pseudolamellibranchiata</em>, <em
class="e000I2">Eulamellibranchiata</em>, <em
class="e000I2">Septibranchiata</em>.</p>

<p>The first includes the simpler type of gill as represented
in the accompanying figure (A). Its filaments are short and not
reflected. The second, represented in Fig. B, has the filaments
long, reflected, and connected (each filament to its adjacent
ones) by means of surface cilia. The third type of gill resembles
the last except that the ends of the filaments of the outer gill
are attached to the mantle, and the ends of the filaments of
the inner gill are attached to the foot or visceral mass. The
fourth type of gill is far more highly <a id="pg421"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg421]</span> developed. The adjacent filaments
are connected, not by cilia, but by vascular channels, and the
depending and recurved portions of each filament are also connected
in a manner presumed to admit of the passage of blood. This gives
to the organ the appearance of basketwork or network. The ends
of the filaments are attached to the mantle and to the visceral
mass, as in the last order, forming cavities or chambers above
(see Fig. C). This order includes the great majority of the <em
class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>.</p>

<p>The fifth and last order is confined to but two rather obscure
families, in which the gill-development is carried to the point of
substitution of muscular partitions which form a separate chamber
connected with the mantle cavity by a narrow slit, the surface
of the chamber having respiratory functions (Fig. D).</p>

<p>The collector of living marine objects who has become fascinated
by their beauty and who derives pleasure from examining
the greater beauty of their structures will find a rich field for
research in the pelecypod gills. But unless he has time at his
disposal and some skill with a microscope, he would do well not
to venture too far into this alluring but difficult and vexatious
subject.</p>

<p>Our coastal waters are fairly rich in bivalves, but the most
strikingly handsome species of this class—and there are many of
them—are inhabitants of warmer seas. Of the great number
of bivalves to be found upon our own shores we can only mention
briefly some of the commonest species.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">PROTOBRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">NUCULIDÆ</em></p>

<p>In this family the gills are of the simplest and most primitive
type. The mantle-edges are entirely open along the ventral
margin, but they are united posteriorly in some of the <em class="e000I2">Nuculidæ</em>
to form two short siphons. The palps are exceedingly large. The
foot is also large, and by its disk-like surface is adapted to creeping,
much as is a gasteropod foot; its edges are often crenulated or
scalloped, and there is no trace of a byssus. The shells are <a id="pg422"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg422]</span>
equivalve, and their most prominent feature is the hinge, which is
beset with sharp, comb-like teeth in two straight rows, one upon
each side of a central pit, a space reserved for the ligament.</p>

<p>Two species of this genus, which are greatly prized by
collectors on account of the extraordinary development of
the epidermis of the shell, occur in New England waters. The
strong corneous periostracum of a deep chestnut-color projects
considerably beyond the margins of the valves; the shells are
exceedingly thin and fragile, and are marked with radiating lines.
The two species are easily distinguished by their difference in
size. <em class="eB00I2">S. velum</em> is about one inch long and
one half of an inch high. <em class="eB00I2">S. borealis</em>, of
arctic range, is quite twice that size. Their anatomy is similar in
essentials to that of <em class="e000I2">Yoldia</em>. These species
live near shore in sandy bottoms, and are occasionally found upon
the beach between tides. Chelsea Beach, just north of Boston, is an
often-quoted locality.</p>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">FILIBRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p>There are several families of this order which are well represented
in both the Atlantic and the Pacific waters of the United
States. The characteristic feature of this group of bivalves is the
filamentous gill, that is, a gill with the filaments long, doubled
back, and united to each other only by ciliary junctures. These <a id="pg424"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg424]</span>
junctures are so slight that they break readily when a specimen
of a gill is handled, leaving the filaments free. The presence of a
byssal gland in the foot, and often a well-developed byssus, is
another characteristic of this order.</p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">ANOMIIDÆ</em></h6>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Anomia</em></p>

<p>This is a family of peculiar and highly specialized forms.
<em class="e000I2">Anomia</em> has an irregularly rounded shell, with one convex and
one flat or concave valve. There is no regular hinge or well-defined
hinge-margin, but a raised fossette, or cartilage plate, occupies
a position at the top of the valves. In the flat valve there
is a large oblong hole just under the apex, through which projects a
calcified byssus, by means of which the animal secures itself to
oysters, dead shells, stones, or any solid object. The anomias, which
have become stationary in habit, have practically lost their foot.
The gills are very large and curved, while all the organs seem to
be abnormally placed on account of the huge byssus and byssal
muscle. For the byssus to pass, as it does, through a specially
prepared hole in one of the valves is an extraordinary departure
from the conventional types of byssiferous species. The heart is
not traversed by the intestine. Altogether, then, <em class="e000I2">Anomia</em> is a very
curious genus.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. simplex.</em> The commoner large form

is exceedingly irregular in shape, and its surface is variously
undulated and plaited in accordance with the surface of the object
to which it is attached. Thousands of these valves, disjointed and
separated, are cast upon the beaches all along our Atlantic coast.
They are light green to salmon-&#160;or copper-color, generally
fragile and scaly, and have a peculiarly dulled (as though greased)
nacre. <a id="pg425"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg425]</span></p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Arca</em></p>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Arcidæ</em> may always be distinguished by the long row of
comb-like teeth upon the hinge, the total want of siphons (a fact
which may be discovered in the shell alone by its lack of a pallial
sinus), and the solid trapezoidal or round shell, with its tendency to
strong ribs radiating from the umbones. The periostracum, or
epidermis, is heavy and often velvety or even hairy. The animal
of <em class="e000I2">Arca</em> has the gills placed in an oblique position; the foot is
large and strongly developed. No trace of mantle fusion exists.
The mantle-edges bear a row of composite eyes. The gill-filaments
are entirely free, there being even no ciliary junctions.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. pexata.</em> An exceedingly
common species in Long Island
Sound and on the coast of New
Jersey. The shell is oblong, with
prominent beaks directed forward.
The hinge-teeth are arranged in
a row posterior to the beaks, while
just under the beaks are a number
of irregular cartilage-pits.
About thirty-two to thirty-six radiating
ribs ornament the shell.
The inner margins of the shell are
rather deeply scalloped; the epidermis
is thick, shaggy, and dark
<a id="pg426"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg426]</span> brown. Length two to two and a quarter inches; height two inches.
<em class="e000I2">A. pexata</em> is one of the few pelecypods which have red blood, a fact
which accounts for its popular name of "bloody clam."</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. ponderosa.</em> The most prominent <em class="e000I2">Arca</em> upon our Atlantic coast,
especially south of Virginia. The beaks of this shell are very prominent,
and do not approach each other very closely on account of the
wide dorsal margin of the shells, the large space between the beaks
being occupied by an external ligament. The hinge-teeth are smaller
in the middle. There are from twenty-five to twenty-eight ribs; the
ventral margin of the valves is somewhat contracted in the middle.
Length two and a half inches; height two inches. Very heavy and
solid. This exceedingly common species is often cast upon the beaches
south of Hatteras in numbers beyond computation. In life it is covered
with a heavy, coarse, velvety epidermis, almost jet-black in color.

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. noæ.</em> The well-known "Noah's-ark" shell, a common species

Mediterranean. Unlike most arcas, it spins a byssus, by means of which
it attaches itself to the under surfaces of stones at low water. The
hinge-margin is perfectly straight and regularly toothed. The beaks
are high and are situated very far forward. The dorsal margin of the
valves is strikingly large, and is marked by lattice-like grooves; it forms
a concave surface over an inch in width between the umbones. The
shell is strongly ribbed without. The ventral margin of the valves is
sinuous and gapes slightly at a central point for the accommodation of
the byssus. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVIII">Plate LXXVIII.</a>)</p></div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Mytilidæ</em> are a large family,
including the mussels, so commonly found between tides upon all
shores. The two ordinary genera <em class="e000I2">Mytilus</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Modiola</em>, which often occur associated
together upon our eastern coast, may readily be distinguished one
from the other by the position of their beaks. In the former genus
the beak is terminal, that is, it is situated at the very tip-end
of the shell; in the latter genus it is not quite terminal. Aside
from this simple feature, the genera are practically the same,
the animals being identical. <em class="e000I2">Mytilus</em> and
<em class="e000I2">Modiola</em>, commonly known as mussels, have
acquired the stationary habit and are provided with a relatively
small foot (in some species amounting to no more than a mere
tubercle); but in place of a useful foot is a well-developed
byssogenous gland, which secretes an <a id="pg427"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg427]</span> exceedingly tough, fibrous byssus. By
means of this the animal may not only attach itself firmly to any
sort of object, but may actually move about. Fibers of the byssus
are thrown out, and, as though possessed of life, they seize upon
objects in the direction in which <em class="e000I2">Mytilus</em>
desires to move, and by contraction of the muscles which control
the byssus the animal is drawn forward, the operation being then
repeated. It must be a very tedious method of travel. However,
the <em class="e000I2">Mytilidæ</em> are not restless creatures.
They pass their lives content to remain firmly fixed to some
object, and their movements, if any, are within a very narrow
circle. The animal has very long gills of the usual filamentous
type. The mantle fuses at one point to form an anal siphon, the
lower or branchial one being, therefore, functional. The palps are
large. One curious feature of this group is the enormous extent of
the genital glands, which actually appear to pervade the entire
structure of the animal, gills, mantle, foot, and all. At times the
whole being is a veritable receptacle for myriads of tiny yellowish
eggs.</p>

fastened by its byssus that the beaks of the valves point downward,
and the ventral margin projects above the sand or mud. The color
of the epidermis in the adult form is black or a deep blue-black;
the shell proper is violet. Hinge-teeth are wanting. Length two and
a half inches. A variety of this species, <em class="eB00I2">M.
pellucidus</em>, is often found associated with the typical form.
It is brightly rayed in green and yellow. <em class="e000I2">M.

used as food. It also occurs (by importation) in San Francisco
Bay.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. hamatus</em> has a more southern range
than has <em class="e000I2">M. edulis</em>, and is found from the
Chesapeake southward. Its shell is considerably twisted just below
the umbonal region, while its whole surface is densely striated.
Its color is dark fuscous. Length one to two inches. It is found in
great numbers attached to oysters by its byssus. In Florida it is
very common. (<a href="#Plate-LXXVIII">Plate LXXVIII.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. californicus.</em> A common west-coast

surface, especially near the ventral margin, is covered with a
tough hairy growth. Length four to five inches. The animal is
orange-red. The great size and swelling fullness of this species
at once distinguish it from all others upon our coast. It is not a
shallow-water form, but is extremely common upon all beaches north
of Hatteras. It also occurs in Alaskan waters to Puget Sound, where
it is known as the "great horse-mussel." Sometimes these large
modiolas may be found in rocky tide-pools which are washed by the
surf at high tide. They hide far back in the crevices of boulders,

inhabits the tidal waters of streams, sheltered muddy reaches among
reeds, and tidal flats. It is a dingy-looking shell, ornamented
with numerous radiating ribs, which are very fine upon the anterior
portion of the shell. The epidermis is thin and of a dirty
yellowish-green color. Within it is silvery-white. In the ventral

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">PSEUDOLAMELLIBRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p>This third order of <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em> is made up of a number of families
in which the gills are filamentous, but in which the filaments <a id="pg430"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg430]</span>
have become united at their ends to the mantle (on the outer gills)
and to the body-mass (on the inner gills). Here also the first traces
of the higher type of gill found in the next order appear; that is, a
gill in which the filaments are connected by vascular channels instead
of by cilia. This order therefore is presumed to connect
the true filamentous type of gill with the fully developed lamellar
type. As the filaments do not always fuse with the mantle or
foot, the description of the pseudolamellibranch gill becomes
somewhat vague, and there is some room for doubt whether this
order should exist at all.</p>

<p>Most of the genera placed in it are monomyarian; that is, they
have but one adductor muscle, or if two, the anterior one is very
small and unimportant. The mantle-edges are entirely open,
there being no regularly formed siphons. As a rule, the foot is
exceedingly small or quite aborted.</p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">AVICULIDÆ</em></h6>

<p>In this family there is an exception to the rule just stated: the
foot is long. There is a byssus, and the gills (by their outer
ascending filaments) are concrescent with the mantle.</p>

<p>The interior of all the <em class="e000I2">Aviculidæ</em> is of a highly polished nacre,
and some of the larger species have been extensively collected for
mother-of-pearl. To the <em class="e000I2">Aviculidæ</em> belong the pearl-oysters
(<em class="e000I2">Meleagrina margaritifera</em>).</p>

<p>A delightful air of romance and adventure surrounds the
pearl-fisheries, about which much has been written. The pearl is an
abnormal product formed by the deposition of nacre around some
foreign object, such as a grain of sand, or—usually, it is said—an
egg which has failed to develop properly. They are seldom
found in individuals having favorable conditions of growth, but
those which are greatly crowded together and covered with various
parasites and growths are most productive of them. The
pearl is the same in substance as the nacreous shell of the pearl-oyster,
and its iridescence is due to the fine striæ of the undulating
layers of which it is composed. The pearl as well as the shell
is produced by the shell-glands of the mantle. The value of the <a id="pg431"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg431]</span>
pearl is based on the brilliancy of the nacre, the size, and the form.
Luster, or "orient," is to the pearl what brilliancy is to the diamond.
The round form has the greatest value, next the pear-shape,
and lastly the oval. Pearls of inferior value are produced
by other species than <em class="e000I2">Meleagrina margaritifera</em>, the true pearl-oyster.
Many bivalves secrete similar bodies, but as they have the nature
of the shell, those produced by mollusks having lusterless interiors
are of no value. Beautiful pink pearls are found in the
gasteropod <em class="e000I2">Strombus gigas</em>, the conch-shell of the West Indies.
The shells of the pearl-oyster are themselves very valuable, being
the "mother-of-pearl" used in the manufacture of buttons, knife-handles,
inlay-work, and so on. They have three grades of commercial
value; of the first are the "silver-lipped," from the South
Seas, of the second the "black-lipped," from Manila and Ceylon,
and of the third the "bullock-shells," from Panama.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. atlantica.</em> A Floridian species which is often found attached by
its byssus to large algæ which have been washed upon the beach. The
shell is reddish-brown, with many white radial lines. Its obliquely oval
shape, the long wing-like extension of the dorsal margin, the inequivalve
shells, and the byssal sinus placed just below the forward extension of
the hinge, are characteristics which will enable one to recognize the species
at once. The structure of the shell is unusual in being so largely
composed of organic matter that it possesses elasticity near its thinner
edges.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. muricata</em> and <em class="eB00I2">P. seminuda</em>. Two species of this family which
are very abundant in Floridian waters and are often to be found associated
upon the muddy or sandy shores of bays. Like <em class="e000I2">Modiola plicatula</em>,
they attach themselves by means of their byssus to shells or stones
which lie under the surface. With the pointed end of the shell directed
downward, they remain almost wholly concealed in the sand. Only
about one quarter of an inch of the broad end of the shell projects
above the sand. The edges of the valves are as sharp as knife-blades,
and great caution must be used while walking barefooted along a beach
inhabited by <em class="e000I2">Pinna</em>. The shells of both species are of a triangular
wedge-shape and are composed of a translucent crystalline matter.
<em class="e000I2">P. muricata</em> is beset with triangular erect scales which project out
like spines. Their edges are also sharp like pieces of broken glass.
<em class="e000I2">P. seminuda</em> also has these raised scales, but they are far more numerous
<a id="pg432"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg432]</span> and much smaller, and are arranged in closely packed radiating
rows, the scales becoming obsolete near the umbones. The mantle of
the animal is doubly fringed, and much decorated upon that portion
which may be protruded from the shell. The posterior adductor is very
large and strong; the anterior one has almost disappeared. The foot
is long and slender, but is evidently a useless appendage, for the animal's
habit is stationary. The byssus is large and very strong. Gloves
have been made from the byssal fibers of <em class="e000I2">Pinna</em> mixed with silk. The
gills are very long and are distinctly <em class="e000I2">not</em> filamentous, the adjacent filaments
being clearly united by vascular channels. A very curious development
of the osphradium (see <a href="#pg339">page 339</a>) into an erectile process capable
of projection beyond the margin of the shell is a unique feature of
<em class="e000I2">Pinna</em>. Sometimes thousands of pinnas are torn loose by storms and
cast upon the beaches. They do not range north of Hatteras. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIX">Plate LXXIX.</a>)</p></div>

rubbish in brackish water. It has a very flat, irregularly shaped shell
of a horn-color, and is from two to three inches across. The distinguishing
feature of <em class="e000I2">Perna</em> is the hinge. It is straight and without teeth, but
is marked by a row of transverse grooves to which the ligament is
attached. These grooves constitute a row of cartilage-pits.</p></div>

two very strong human cravings—those of vanity and hunger.</p>

<p>Few realize what an enormous business the oyster trade has
become in the United States. The value of it is stated to be over
thirteen million dollars annually, twenty-five million bushels of
oysters being taken from the Chesapeake alone. The edibility of
the oyster has been known from early times, for vast heaps of empty
oyster-shells, known as kitchen-middens, occur in various parts
of the world. Some of them are of such size and extent as to
warrant the belief that their formation must have required centuries.
Shell-mounds are found along the coasts of Florida and
are of some archæological value. The cultivation of oysters as
recorded by Pliny dates from the first century <em class="e0U003">B.C.</em>, at which <a id="pg433"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg433]</span>
time a Roman named Sergius Orata first cultivated oysters at
Baiæ. The acuteness of the gastronomic sense of a Roman
epicure is thus described by Juvenal:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p><span style="padding-left:10em;">He could tell</span></p>
<p>At the first mouthful if his oysters fed</p>
<p>On the Rutupian or the Lucrine bed</p>
<p>Or at Circeii.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The poet Gay's opinion is expressed thus:</p>

<div class="poembox"><div class="poem">
<p>The man had sure a palate cover'd o'er</p>
<p>With brass or steel, that on the rocky shore</p>
<p>First broke the oozy oyster's pearly coat,</p>
<p>And risk'd the living morsel down his throat.</p>
</div></div>

<p>The methods employed in oyster-farming resemble those of
agriculture, in that the bed is prepared, seed is sown, superfluous
and foreign growths are weeded out, enemies are driven off, and
the crop is harvested at stated seasons. The oyster is ovoviviparous;
that is, it retains its eggs until they are partly matured.
These are held in the gills and mantle folds until the time of
spawning, which begins in May and lasts through the summer
months. The larvæ are ejected as ciliated spheres, called spat,
and swim freely about for some time, often several days, before
finding a resting-spot. The oyster-grower secures many of the
larvæ by placing in their way substances to which they can
attach themselves. The American culturist strews his carefully
prepared beds with empty oyster-shells, on which the spat settle,
and the seed is thus secured; for the spat, once fastened, lose
the power of locomotion and become fixed. At the end of a
year the shells which hold the young oysters (now about an inch
long and called "fry") are taken up, and the fry are thinned out
and replanted, or are sold to other oyster-farmers.</p>

<p>During the period of their growth the oysters are sometimes
transplanted several times. At the end of three to five years they
have attained marketable size, and the beds are then harvested
and prepared for another crop. Some oystermen have several
acres of bottom under cultivation. These areas are obtained by
purchase or grant from the State, and their limits are as defined <a id="pg434"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg434]</span>
as are the fenced-off acres of upland meadows. The business of
the oyster-culturist is to plant the young oysters and watch their
development, keeping the beds thinned, that the oysters may
not be too crowded for their normal and symmetrical growth,
and protecting them from their enemies, of which there are many.
The principal enemies of the oyster are the starfish and the predaceous
mollusks <em class="e000I2">Urosalpinx</em> and <em class="e000I2">Nassa</em>. Whole beds have been
known to be destroyed in a single night by the visitations of
starfishes, hence a constant watchfulness is required on the part
of the oysterman. Policing the oyster-farms is another of
his cares, for pirates abound, and a bed may be robbed in the
night as easily as an orchard may be despoiled of its fruit. Oyster-culture
is carried on extensively in Long Island Sound, on the
coasts of New Jersey and Virginia, and in the Chesapeake Bay.
The oysters from certain localities are esteemed more than others,
the flavor of the oyster being very dependent upon the purity
of the water and on the organisms upon which it feeds. It has
been definitely shown that oysters grown in contaminated waters
have been the agents of transmitting disease, notably typhoid
fever and cholera.</p>

<p>Oyster-culture has reached the highest degree of perfection in
France, where miles of muddy shores left by the ebb-tide are utilized
for the purpose. The famous <em class="e000I2">parc</em> at Arcachon, covering
ten thousand acres, illustrates the system generally practised.
The spat is there collected on tiles coated with cement, piled in
layers crosswise, and secured in crates. These tiles are exposed
in favorable localities and collect the swimming embryos. The
rough cement holding the spat is then chipped off the tiles and
placed in wire trays. These <em class="e000I2">ambulances</em>, or <em class="e000I2">caisses ostreophiles</em>,
placed between short posts, protect the fry from their enemies.
At low tide the young oysters are carefully examined
and sorted, and at the right age they are removed to open areas.
The parc is divided into regular squares by canals of suitable
width, some of the squares having banks and gates to retain the
water of the receding tide if desired. Each man's parc is separated
from that of his neighbor by canals of greater width, and
often by stakes having a few branches on the ends. These <a id="pg435"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg435]</span>
<em class="e000I2">pignons</em>, which sway in the wind, are said to frighten away the predaceous
ray which is apt to hover about the preserves. The
parcs are finally thinned out by sending the oysters to other
parcs to be fattened. There is a celebrated <em class="e000I2">parc d'élevage</em> at
Marennes. It is a collection of artificial ponds, the floors of
which are covered with algæ, which harbor vast numbers of
diatoms and other microscopic organisms on which the oysters
feed. The green diatom (<em class="e000I2">Navicula ostrearia</em>) gives to the oysters
of Marennes the green color and peculiar flavor which is so much
esteemed by the epicures of France. To the American, however,
the green oyster is not acceptable.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Ostrea</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. virginica.</em> A description of this species, our common oyster, is
hardly necessary. Every one has seen the rough, shaggy, unlovely
shell. The hinge is toothless, but has a wide depression for the ligament.
The animal, having stationary habits, has practically no foot at
all. There is but one large adductor muscle, around which curve the
gills, the latter being united to each other posteriorly. The mantle
margin is finely and doubly fringed. Although <em class="e000I2">Ostrea</em> is a stationary
mollusk, it has no byssus.</p>

<p><em class="e000I2">O. virginica</em> has been introduced at San Francisco, where it lives
well, but does not seem to multiply very rapidly. The native species,
<em class="eB00I2">O. lurida</em>, is about two inches long, dark in color, and stained a purplish
hue. It is not very delicately flavored.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">O. frons.</em> This species has a thinner shell than <em class="e000I2">O. virginica</em>, with
coarsely serrated margins. It occurs in beds in the neighborhood of
mangroves all along our South Atlantic shores. It cannot compare
with its Northern relative in flavor, but, like the European
<em class="eB00I2">Ostrea edulis</em>, it is sometimes "not bad."</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">PECTINIDÆ</em></h6>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Pecten</em></p>

<p>The scallop-shells (<em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>) are objects too familiar to require
any general description. The rounded valve, usually ornamented
with radiating ribs, and the wing-like projections (called "ears"),
from each side of the umbonal region, are never-failing characters.
The outline of <em class="e000I2">Pecten</em> has been considerably employed
in conventional designs for mural decorations; indeed, the figure <a id="pg436"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg436]</span>
of a well-known Mediterranean pecten (<em class="e000I2">P. jacobius</em>), found commonly
in Palestine, became an emblem of religious significance
during the middle ages. Returning crusaders fastened to their
garments a specimen of "St. James's shell" as an evidence of the
fact that they had been to the Holy Land, and the design of the
shell came to be adopted upon many coats of arms and also in the
insignia of various orders of devout and adventurous knights of
the middle ages.</p>

<p>The animal is of the highest type of monomyarian mollusks,
that is, of bivalve mollusks with only a single adductor muscle.
Unlike most pelecypods, which have a very small foot, <em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>
rarely has a byssus, and is neither a stationary nor a sluggish creature.
It can propel itself through the water by spasmodically closing
and opening its valves, in an eccentric, darting sort of flight,
though most of the time it rests quietly upon the bottom. The
mantle is entirely open and highly ornate about its margin,
which is, furthermore, the seat of many eyes, capable, apparently,
of no mean degree of vision. The adductor muscle is very
large and strong, and occupies a central position, about which the
gills circle; the latter are plainly filamentous.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. magellanicus.</em> The largest of the east-coast species of <em class="e000I2">Pecten</em>.
It is a Northern species, and was long known by the name of
<em class="eB00I2">P. tenuiscostatus</em>—a
name given to it on account of its very numerous radiating
striæ; but it was later discovered that the North Atlantic form was
in reality the same as the <em class="e000I2">P. magellanicus</em> of Patagonia. The latter being
the older name and entitled to priority, our shell became <em class="e000I2">P. magellanicus</em>,
the other name falling within its synonymy. The length and height of
this scallop are from five to five and a half inches. One valve is more
convex and slightly larger than the other, the smaller being lighter in
color. The valves gape considerably along their upper margin below
the hinge. The cartilage-pit is deep. North of Cape Ann this large
species is of common occurrence in moderately deep water. The deeper
bays and arms of the sea which everywhere penetrate the Maine coast
are its favorite resorts. A good way to catch pectens is to lower a fishing-line
at a spot where the fishermen report "scallop-ground," and drag it
along over the bottom. Sooner or later it will enter the open shell of
some pecten, which will instantly close its valves upon the string and
allow itself to be drawn out of the water. In Maine these large scallops
are eaten, but they have not found great favor in the city markets. In
color they vary from reddish through brown to ashen.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. islandicus.</em> A species not so large
as the last, with more prominently raised ribs (about fifty
to one hundred in number), which are <a id="pg437"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg437]</span> covered with a multitude of erect
scales. The ribs persist upon the interior of the shell. The "ears"
are unequal in size. The color is light orange to reddish-brown,
with zones of darker and richer color. One valve is flatter than
the other and more lightly colored. Greatest length about three
inches; height three and a half inches. This is a Northern shell,
belonging to the waters of Newfoundland, but its valves are
frequently cast upon the New England beaches.</p></div>

does not range north of Boston, but finds an extensive habitat
to the south. Its metropolis is Cape Cod, Long Island Sound, and
the Jersey coast waters. This is the true scallop of the Boston
and New York markets. Only the adductor muscle is eaten. In this
species there is not so marked a difference in the convexity of
the two valves. There are about twenty elevated and rounded ribs,
the spaces between them being also rounded. The color is variable,
from a blackish horn to ashen gray. The "ears" are equal; the
interior is shining, and grooved to correspond with the external
ribs. Length two and three fifths inches, height two and a half
inches. On clear, calm days the immature individuals of this
species may often be seen in shallow water disporting themselves
most gaily, skipping about and snapping their valves in great glee.
Their mantle margins are very ornate in scarlet or orange, with
rows of bright-blue eyes. Care must be taken in handling scallops,
especially the large <em class="e000I2">P. magellanicus</em>, for a
finger caught between the valves will be badly bruised.</p></div>

playful habits as <em class="e000I2">P. irradians</em>, and is not
at all easy to capture. When pursued it dives into the mud, and
sets up such a commotion by the spasmodic opening and shutting of
its valves that the water at once becomes roiled, and the scallop
is safely hidden in its murky depths. <a id="pg438"></a><span

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. hastatus.</em> There are several
very beautiful pectens on the Pacific coast of the United
States, and two of these—one of northern and the other of
southern range—resemble very closely the two Atlantic species
of relatively north and south range, <em class="e000I2">P.
islandicus</em> and <em class="e000I2">P. irradians</em> or <em
class="e000I2">dislocatus</em>. The first is <em class="e000I2">P.
hastatus</em> of Puget Sound. Valves of this exquisite shell are
even occasionally found in California. It has very much the aspect
of <em class="e000I2">P. islandicus</em>—unequal ears and an ovate
form. The most curious thing about this shell is the fact that
a different system of sculpturing exists upon the two valves.
Upon one the ribs are even and the whole surface is covered with
raised scales; upon the other the ribs are alternately of large
and small size. Color rose-pink, with deeper bands; one valve
lighter-colored, suffused with delicate pink. Height two and a half
inches. (<a href="#Plate-LXXIX">Plate LXXIX.</a>)</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. æquisulcatus.</em> The Southern
species above referred to as resembling <em class="e000I2">P.
irradians</em> or <em class="e000I2">dislocatus</em>. It has about
twenty stout, well-rounded ribs, with concentric wrinkles between
them. The "ears" are equal. The size and shape are as in <em
class="e000I2">P. irradians</em>. The coloring is whitish, varying
to shades of brown, and excentrically marked with spots or waving
transverse lines of chestnut or horn.</p></div>

<h5>ORDER <em class="eBU001">EULAMELLIBRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p>With the pectens we leave behind all pelecypods with
the true filamentous type of gill. In the order <em
class="e000I2">Eulamellibranchiata</em> we find all the families to
be possessed of the basketwork or crisscross branchial structure.
Each gill is fundamentally formed of filaments which project
downward, and then suddenly turn upon themselves and ascend; the
ascending and descending limbs are connected, however, by processes
of presumably vascular function, and adjacent filaments are
connected by truly vascular channels. The closer connection of the
filaments to form of each gill a sort of plate is further effected
<a id="pg439"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg439]</span> by connective
tissue, which sometimes is dense enough (though always porous)
to obscure the reticulated appearance of the organ. Furthermore,
the edge of the outer lamella of the outer gill unites with the
mantle; likewise the edge of the inner lamella of the inner gill
unites with the body-mass, and <em class="e000I2">behind the
body-mass</em> with the gills upon the other side of the animal.
This union of the four gills in a straight median line behind the
foot and body-mass forms a septum, which divides off from the
mantle cavity a "suprabranchial" cavity. Into this cavity the
excreta are discharged, and with it the anal or excurrent siphon
connects. The branchial or incurrent siphon thus pours its current
of water into the <em class="e000I2">lower</em> mantle cavity, to
bathe the gills and feed the mouth, while the fresh water is not
contaminated by any open and wide connection with the excretory
processes. In many of the forms where the siphons are very long and
united, this septum, formed by the union of the dorsal edges of the
inner gills back of the foot, is continued far into the siphons,
constituting the division of the two into the anal and branchial
siphons.</p>

<p>Another feature of this order is the marked tendency to mantle
fusion. As there are always siphons, the mantle-edges must
necessarily have fused at two points at least, in order to have
formed the siphons. The tendency, however, is for the fusion to
continue, narrowing the pedal opening more and more, as though
the mantle were endeavoring to envelop the entire animal in a bag
or sac open only at one end (siphonal opening), but yet slightly
ripped along one seam (pedal opening).</p>

<p>This order includes the great majority of pelecypods, and admits
of many very confusing modifications in its most essential features.</p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">CARDITIDÆ</em></h6>

<p>In this, the first family of the order, most of the characteristic
features just spoken of are present. Mantle fusion, however, has
not progressed beyond a degree which is just sufficient to form
the siphons. There is a byssiferous gland. The name <em class="e000I2">Carditidæ</em>
refers to the heart-shape of the shells. <a id="pg440"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg440]</span></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. borealis.</em> A very common species north of Cape Ann, reported
also in deeper water as far south as Hatteras. It is a solid, obliquely
heart-shaped shell, with beaks elevated and turned forward. It has
about eighteen to twenty rounded radiating ribs,
which are broader than the grooves between
them. The epidermis is rusty-brown. The hinge
is strong, with two prominent teeth; the margins
of the shell are strongly crenulated within.
Length one inch; height about the same. This
is not strictly a between-the-tides species, but
its valves are often cast upon the beaches. Fine
specimens may be obtained by dredging at Bar
Harbor or Eastport.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. floridana.</em> A very common Floridian
species. Its seventeen or eighteen ribs are very
heavy, and are rendered nodulous by the numerous
bluntly raised scales upon them. The shell is lengthened, and has a
well-defined lunule and an external ligament. In color it is yellowish-white,
with purple markings when young. Length one inch; height three
fourths of an inch. It lives in sheltered bays; detached valves are
often found cast upon the beach.</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Astarte</em></p>

<p>Notwithstanding their rather small size, there is a trimness
about the shells of <em class="e000I2">Astarte</em> which, taken together with their
rich chestnut epidermis, makes them very interesting and desirable
additions to the cabinet. The family is one of cold-water
range, with a few representatives on the New England coast.
Live specimens are not easily captured, for they live in deeper
water than one would care to wade in, nevertheless they are frequently
cast upon the beaches after storms. The animal has a
very short efferent siphon, large labial palps, and very obliquely
placed gills. Not more than twenty living species of <em class="e000I2">Astarte</em> are
known, and all of them belong in, or are wanderers from, polar
seas. Fully three hundred fossil species of this genus have been
described from Mesozoic rocks in all parts of the world. The
question naturally arises whether in these its dying days <em class="e000I2">Astarte</em>
has sought colder waters in which to pass its remaining existence,
or whether climates have changed. The fact that such strictly <a id="pg441"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg441]</span>
tropical genera as <em class="e000I2">Voluta</em> and <em class="e000I2">Conus</em> are found fossil in northern
Siberia seems to be evidence in proof of great climatic variations.</p>

prominent beaks. The surface is very slightly undulated and is
covered with a thick chestnut epidermis with pale and dark zones.
The hinge is broad and flat, with a prominent cardinal tooth upon

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A.</em> (<em class="eB00I2">Cyprina</em>)
<em class="eB00I2">islandica</em>. This clam has a thick though

small. A striking feature of this species, which at once separates
<a id="pg442"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg442]</span> it from all
other shells of our coast of similar size, is the coarse, wrinkled
epidermis of black to chestnut color. The shell is very suggestive
of a large, overgrown <em class="e000I2">Astarte</em>. Length three
and a half inches; height three inches. It is found of all sizes,
down to one fourth of an inch in diameter, upon muddy stations
in moderately deep water near the mouths of rivers; but the
surest way to get it is to search the beach after a hard onshore
gale.</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">LUCINIDÆ</em></h6>

<p>This family finds its metropolis in warmer waters, and the best
representatives of it must be sought for upon the Floridian
beaches or in the shallow bays of that sandy coast. A long vermiform
foot is a characteristic of the animal, as is also the fact
that at times there is only a single gill upon each side of
the body. In some of the <em class="e000I2">Lucinidæ</em>, more so than in most other
pelecypods, the chief function of the gills is to furnish a brooding-place
for the thousands of ova which the creatures generate.
Sometimes a <em class="e000I2">Lucina</em> will be captured with the gills swollen out of
all proportion, and literally stuffed with tiny, microscopic eggs.
At such times the gills lose all semblance of branchial organs.
The shells are orbicular, with depressed small umbones, a distinct
lunule, a semi-external ligament, two cardinal teeth, and laterals
(a variable feature). There is no pallial sinus. The color is
white, and the outlines are rounded.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. tigrina.</em> The largest of the group, measuring three inches across

only in southern Florida and is abundant in shallow water on sandy stations.

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. floridana.</em> One of the most abundant bivalves in Florida, often

of a light straw-color. The shell is pure white. Diameter about
one inch. (<a href="#Plate-LXXX">Plate LXXX.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">L. pennsylvanica.</em> A species often associated with the last, but about
twice as large. Its thin but tough epidermis clings to the shell in raised
concentric lines, giving it a circularly ribbed appearance. The most
prominent feature of this species is a depressed line upon either valve
extending obliquely from the umbones to the posterior ventral margin,
<a id="pg443"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg443]</span> causing, at the margin, a pucker or break in its even continuity. The

account of the weak hinge ligament, the valves become easily separated,
and it is not always easy to find two that will exactly match. <em class="e000I2">Loripes</em>
preserves the same circular outlines as <em class="e000I2">Lucina</em>, but is more ventricose,

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Tellina</em></p>

<p>If we should create an aristocracy of beauty among the bivalves,
as has been done by conchologists among the gasteropods, this
family would deserve high rank. Most of the American species
of <em class="e000I2">Tellina</em> are too small to impress one very greatly with their
beauty, but in the West Indies and in the tropical Pacific waters
are some wonderfully handsome shells belonging to this or
to the allied genus <em class="e000I2">Macoma</em>. However, we have in Florida the
very striking <em class="e000I2">T. radiata</em>, a truly beautiful shell, which, were it
less common, would be highly prized in collections. Rarity, no
doubt, adds a wonderful luster to shells as well as to gems. The <a id="pg444"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg444]</span>
animal of <em class="e000I2">Tellina</em> has long, slender siphons, which are separate.
The gills are small, and the outer lamella or branchial fold is
directed dorsally. Although the foot shows evidences of a byssogenous
gland, there is no actual byssus. The shells are porcelanous
and translucent, equivalve, with an external ligament,
and at least two cardinal teeth in each valve.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. radiata.</em> This species varies from three to four inches in length,
and from one and a half to one and three fourths inches in height. It is
highly polished, shining white, and yellowish about the umbonal region,
and has three wide rays of bright pink extending from the beaks to the
ventral margin. On account of its remarkable coloration it is called the
"setting-sun shell." Its surface is smooth. A common variety is of a
uniform creamy-white color with carnation beaks. This shell is always
offered for sale by the marine curio-&#160;and shell-dealers in Florida seaside
resorts, and at Atlantic City, Cape May, and elsewhere.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. alternata</em> resembles the last in
shape, being flattish and oblong, but it is more pointed or
angulated posteriorly. There is also a slight twist in the
posterior end of the shell. Its surface is decorated by numerous
impressed concentric lines. The color is uniformly white or
yellowish, with pink rays. Length two and a half to three inches;
height two and a half inches. Found from Hatteras to the Gulf of
Mexico, in shallow, sandy stations and on beaches after storms.
(<a href="#Plate-LXXXI">Plate LXXXI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. bodegensis.</em> The most striking species
of <em class="e000I2">Tellina</em> found on the west coast, and
of rather northern range. It is about two inches in length,

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Donacidæ</em> are represented upon our coasts by comparatively
few species, all belonging to the genus <em class="e000I2">Donax</em>. The shells
are under an inch in length, and have a peculiarly shortened anterior
portion; thus they are inequilateral. Their ventral margins
are finely denticulate. The pallial sinus is deep. There are
two or three cardinal teeth and a variable number of laterals.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. variabilis.</em> This little shell, the common Floridian form, exhibits
every imaginable scheme of color-combination, and defies general or
comprehensive description. Probably the most usual pattern developed
is a bluish-white background with purplish radiating lines. Another
is a pure-white foundation with red lines. The surface is striated longitudinally
with excessively fine riblets. Length one half of an inch or
slightly more. In March and April these shells are thrown alive in
millions upon the Florida beaches. Each wave seems to be laden with
them, and when the foaming waters of each spent breaker recede, the
little shells lie still upon the sand for a moment, glittering like jewels in
the sunlight; then, with a sudden protrusion of the foot and a quick
turn, they all disappear like a flash, buried in the sand before the next
breaker strikes them. One must be very quick to catch these active little
mollusks. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXI">Plate LXXXI.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">D. californicus.</em> Professor Keep very aptly describes this shell,
which is very common in California, as "short and stumpy, cut
nearly square off at one end (anterior), and tapering to a rounded edge
at the other." The same description fits both this and the Floridian <em class="e000I2">D.
variabilis</em> so well that the two forms may be one and the same species.
<a id="pg446"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg446]</span> If they were shells of arctic range it would be easier to connect them;
but as neither is a cold-water form, it becomes more difficult to place
them under one name. The increasing number of similar species being
found upon the Atlantic and Pacific sides of Central America points
almost conclusively to the existence of a waterway between the two
oceans, somewhere between North and South America, at no very remote
geological period. Possibly the closing of some such waterway through
the isthmus connecting the oceans has separated these forms geographically,
thus leading us to separate them specifically. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXI">Plate LXXXI.</a>)</p></div>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em
class="eB00I2">Mactra</em></p>

<p>The mactras live in the sand near the margin of the water,
often upon the exposed open coast. The mantle is open, except
where it is fused to form the siphons. These are short and united.
The outer gill is dorsally directed; that is to say, it does not
depend into the mantle cavity as does the inner gill, but projects
just the other way; it is also smaller than the inner one. The
foot is strong, bent, and tongue-shaped, and no doubt well adapted
to the rough life in the surf and the heavy, shifting sands.
The main characteristic of the mactra shell is the prominent
triangular-shaped fossette, or cartilage plate, situated internally
and just under the beaks. The shells are equivalve, and devoid
of bright colors or striking sculptural features. Internally the
pallial line is plain, and the sinus well marked but not deep.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. solidissima</em> is one of the very
commonest, if not the commonest large bivalve of the New
England, Long Island, and New Jersey <a id="pg447"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg447]</span> beaches. It is covered with a thin
brownish or straw-colored epidermis, usually more or less worn away
in adult specimens and wholly absent from the dead valves found
upon the beaches. There is a fragile V-shaped cardinal tooth, which
is generally broken away in forcing open the valves; the lateral
teeth are long and thin, and striated on their receiving surfaces.
The length of this "giant clam" is from four to seven inches. This
is the first shell the collector will find (north of Hatteras) when
he goes to an open, sandy beach.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. similis.</em> A small variety of the
species last described, of similar outline, but less heavy
and strong. Its range is from Hatteras southward to Brazil.
Passing from New Jersey to Hatteras, <em class="e000I2">Mactra
solidissima</em> diminishes in size, and after passing that faunal
barrier the Northern form is entirely replaced by this Southern
variety. The shell is brighter, though not exactly bright-shining.
Its habits are entirely similar to those of the Northern form. On
the west coast of Florida it is the most abundant bivalve upon the
beaches.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. ovalis.</em> A species of Northern range,
which so greatly resembles <em class="e000I2">M. solidissima</em>
as to suggest identity; but the lateral teeth are smooth and not
striated, while the shell itself seldom attains a length of over
four inches.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. lateralis.</em> An exceedingly common
shell, found in all the salt-marshes and tidal estuaries of our
coast. It is much smaller than the mactras just described, being
not over one half of an inch in length. It is white, and is covered
with a dirty brown epidermis; the hinge is strong, with deep
cartilage fossette and a V-shaped marginal tooth. The laterals are
long and slender. The animal has a strong foot and two slender,
long siphons which are yellow in color.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">R. (Labiosa) canaliculata.</em> In
this species the cartilage fossette is the same as in <em
class="e000I2">Mactra</em>; the marginal teeth are feeble, and
there are no laterals. The shells of <em class="e000I2">Mactra</em>
which we have examined are heavy or at least solid, but <em
class="e000I2">Ræta</em> is thin and fragile; it is pure white in
color and is gracefully ornamented by concentric raised ribs. The
shell is inflated and gapes slightly posteriorly; it is shining
white within and is deeply grooved concentrically in accordance
with the external ribs. Length two and a half, height two inches.
From Hatteras to Mexico, this is one of the commoner beach shells,
but since, as in some other species already named, the hinge
ligament and teeth are feeble, the valves become separated by the
buffeting of the waves, and are cast disjointed and singly upon the
beaches. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXI">Plate LXXXI.</a>)</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">VENERIDÆ</em></h6>

<p>In many respects this is the most distinguished pelecypod family.
It is the largest in number of genera and species, is of
world-wide distribution, and supplies to hungry man a number <a id="pg448"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg448]</span>
of comestible species. Several of its genera have been named
after various goddesses and nymphs on account of the great
beauty of their shells. But from a purely biological point of
view also the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em> have claims to distinction, for they seem
to represent about the highest type of shell-development among
the bivalves. The test is extremely hard and often porcelanous.
It is solid without being ponderous and unwieldy in the sense of
causing the animal to be helplessly overburdened by the sheer
weight of its shell. The valves are equal and have three
stout cardinal teeth. The foot is strong, the animal is active,
the siphons are free or partially united, and the gills are more or
less crumpled and folded. There is a compactness and well-regulated
arrangement of the organs in the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>, which impress
one who has examined the anatomy of many pelecypods much
as a well-built, efficient, and space-economizing machine would
impress a mechanic. None of the organs are weak or crowded
out to furnish room for the undue or awkward development of
other organs. A good balance is preserved between them all,
the result being a high type of pelecypod.</p>

<p>If we do not expect to find any of the more remarkable forms
of the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em> upon our shores we shall be the less disappointed
when returning from collecting-expeditions. Nevertheless, there
are a few species of <em class="e000I2">Cytherea</em>, <em class="e000I2">Dosinia</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Tivela</em> in North American
waters which are very handsome shells; but those of our
species which are included under the generic name <em class="e000I2">Venus</em> are in
point of beauty not worthy of their promising name.</p>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Venus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">V. mercenaria.</em> This is the common
"hard-shell clam," the "Little Neck" of the hotels and restaurants,
with which every one in New York and New England is familiar. The
species ranges from Cape Cod to Florida, and occupies two different
kinds of station: one in shallow muddy bays near low-tide mark,
in estuaries, etc.; the other the sandy stations in open deeper
bays or the open ocean. Those coming from "outside" have thinner,
more delicate shells, with thin, concentric ribs. They burrow in
the sand or mud, or crawl quite rapidly. The siphons are short
and are united almost to their ends. The mantle is open (save for
the siphons), and the edges are delicately frilled. In the United
States this species is very extensively gathered for the markets.
When the oyster season closes in April, the hard-shell clam comes
into vogue, the season lasting until September or October. The
clams are <a id="pg449"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg449]</span>
extensively gathered in the estuaries from Cape May to Cape Cod.
Men armed with rakes drift about in small boats and fish the
sluggish creatures up out of the mud. They will live for many days
out of water if kept in a cool place. Smaller or immature clams are
better for the table, since they are not so tough as their elders.
A few features of the shell of this species are noticeable—the
rather prominent umbones directed forward, the heart-shaped
lunule, the external ligament, the concentric sculpturing of
growth-lines, the pure-white interior (with occasionally violet
zones about the muscle-scars and margin), the three stout cardinal
teeth, the sharp-angled pallial sinus, and the ventral margin
finely crenulated within. The greatest length is about three
inches and the height two and a half inches, but these dimensions
exceed those of the clams usually served upon the half-shell. <em
class="e000I2">V. mercenaria</em> ranges into Florida, increasing
in size and bulk as it meets the warmer waters of the Gulf
Stream. The Floridian form has received the varietal name of <em
class="e000I2">mortoni</em>. This massive clam sometimes weighs
five pounds, and is fully six inches in diameter. Aside from its
great size and thickness, the characters of the shell are wholly
those of the smaller Northern form. It is abundant in shallow,
muddy, brackish bays, and is gathered by men who "tread out" the
clams, feeling for them in the mud and sand with bare feet. The
flesh is tough and disagreeably strong, yet the natives appear to
relish it, especially when it is made into a chowder.</p></div>

concentric ridges, between which are much smaller and more numerous
radiating riblets. The color is dirty white to light yellow-brown
without, and white and violet within. There are three cardinal
teeth and no laterals. The lunule is heart-shaped; the posterior
margin is broadened into a wide, concave area into which the
concentric ridges do not pass. Length one to one and a fourth
inches; height the same. Sometimes the beaches in Florida will
in places be banked up with the valves of this very abundant <em

porcelanous, is covered with a pinkish, livid epidermis, and is
decorated with numerous longitudinal color-rays of lilac. The rays
are usually broken and interrupted. Within it is china-white, and
has a deep pallial sinus. It is very abundant on the west coast of
Florida, at Sanibel Island, Egmont Key, Lake Worth, and on beaches.

also shining and corneous. Within it is china-white in color. The
pallial sinus is very deep and wide. Length two and a half to three
inches; height one and a half to two inches. This also is a shell
to be looked for upon the beach after storms, but it will probably
not be seen on the east coast of Florida, although it occurs on
the Keys and also at Hatteras. Both of the species have been used

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Tapes</em></p>

<p>This is a prominent genus of the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>. Its chief feature
is the total want of lateral teeth. There are several large species
in California.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. staminea, T. laciniata.</em> These are the most noticeable species.
The former is sold in the San Francisco markets as the "hard-shell clam."
The shell of this species is from two to three inches in length and of
somewhat less height, rounded, and heavy. The sculpturing consists of
radiating ribs traversed by strongly marked growth-lines. The teeth
are strong, and the pallial sinus is deep. <em class="e000I2">T. laciniata</em> is much like the last,
but its surface is reticulated by a crisscross design that is very striking.
It also has a deep pallial sinus. These two species are of Southern range.
They burrow in gravelly places, among stones, between tide-marks, and
their presence may frequently be detected when walking along the beach
at low tide by seeing a sudden jet of water ejected from a little hole in
the mud or gravel. The animal, becoming alarmed at the approach of
something, suddenly snaps shut its valves, and thus forces out some
water through its siphons. The foot is very strong and often byssiferous
in this genus. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXIII">Plate LXXXIII.</a>) <a id="pg452"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg452]</span></p></div>

might better be considered as its subgenus. The shell is brownish-white,
three to four inches in length, and heavy, rough, and coarse-looking,
with irregular concentric ridges. There is no lunule, but a large
external ligament is very prominent just back of the beaks. Within it
is white, with a deep pallial sinus. Just below the ligament area is a
zone of translucent, agate-like shell-structure. This large clam, with
several others of the same genus, lives in shallow water near shore.</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">PETRICOLIDÆ</em></h6>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. pholadiformis.</em> Along the Jersey coast, especially about Atlantic
City, there are small patches of clay or hard tenacious mud which lie
just at the edge of the sea. As the beating of the surf gradually
encroaches upon these hard fragments of once extensive clay-beds, many
specimens of this curious bivalve mollusk are washed
out from their burrows in this clay and cast upon the
sandy beach. The animal has long siphons which are
united about one third of the way to their ends. Although
this creature is allied to the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>, the degree
of mantle fusion present is much greater, leaving in this
case only a fairly long slit through which the foot may
protrude. The shell is very dissimilar to that of any of
the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>, and in many respects, judging from a
conventional standard, is a remarkable form. It is exceedingly
thin, is of a chalky texture, gapes widely posteriorly,
and is ornamented with transverse ribs, which
are feeble upon the long produced posterior portion of
the shell, but strong in the anterior part, where they are
crossed by the coarse lines of growth, which appear like
vaulted scales upon the ribs. The color is a dull white.
There are two cardinals in each valve and no laterals.
Length one and a quarter to two and a half inches;
height one half to three quarters of an inch. This
species passes its entire life in the burrow it has made
for itself in the clay. Its only motions are made in climbing to the entrance
of its burrow or in retreating far out of sight within its depths.
Its siphons are tipped with a dark or drab color as a measure of protection
from the predaceous crabs which range about the mud surfaces near
tidal marks, and are always upon the lookout for succulent bits of
flesh.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. carditoides.</em> A petricola of the Californian coast, very similar in its
habits to the east-coast form. It bores, however, not only into clay, but
also into soft rocks in order to effect a permanent lodgment. Often this
species occupies a hole which it has discovered already existing; in this
case its shell grows to fit the surroundings. The hinge-teeth, and sculpturing
are frequently reduced and sometimes are quite obsolete; but
the shell has the chalky, thin texture that is characteristic of the genus. <a id="pg453"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg453]</span></p>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">CARDIIDÆ</em></h6>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Cardium</em></p>

<p>This is another important family of the <em class="e000I2">Pelecypoda</em>, which,
with the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>, the <em class="e000I2">Mactridæ</em>, and the <em class="e000I2">Tellinidæ</em>, is entitled to
distinction on account of its high organization, its high type of
shell, its universal geographical distribution, and its great beauty.
The dominant genus is <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em>—a name given on account of the
fact that the shell is shaped like a heart. The animal has a very long,
recurved, and surprisingly strong foot. The mantle-edges are quite
freely open to the siphonal region and are highly papillate and
waved. The siphons are usually very short, but have wide exterior
openings and are also strongly papillate about their margins.
The gills are obliquely situated, and seem to be thicker and heavier
than is usual in pelecypods; they are much folded, the outer
lamella being the smaller. With such a pointed foot and such
short siphons <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em> is obviously not a deep-burrowing genus;
but it does partially bury itself in soft semi-liquid sand. Its progression
is effected by leaps which it is enabled to make by reaching
far out with its foot, then suddenly twisting to one side and
throwing the shell several inches. The shell is ventricose, is
closed or gapes slightly posteriorly, and has prominent subcentral
umbones and an external ligament. The sculpture-scheme of
<em class="e000I2">Cardium</em> (if the shell is not perfectly smooth) is one of radiating
ribs or ridges, which, being regular, form a perfect crenulation of
the ventral margin. There are two cardinal teeth in the center,
and one lateral tooth upon both the anterior and the posterior side:
the latter are situated at some little distance from the beaks.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. magnum.</em> The largest and finest "cockle" of the east coast of the
United States. It is, indeed, one of the finest cockles in the world. The
almost perfect heart-shape is striking. The posterior side is somewhat
flatly depressed. The thirty-three to thirty-seven regularly disposed,
broad, radiating ribs; the regularly crenulated margins; the
yellowish-brown color garnished with transverse rows of chestnut or
<a id="pg454"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg454]</span> purple lines or spots; the brownish-purple posterior area—all combine
to make this large <em class="e000I2">Cardium</em> a beautiful species. Its length is four inches;
height five and a quarter inches. It is a very abundant species on the
open Florida beaches, where it is often left exposed and alive at very
low tides. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXIV">Plate LXXXIV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. isocardia.</em> This also is a Floridian species, of elongated heart-shape
and with radiating ribs. It is not more than half as large as the
last-described species. The ribs are decorated with erect vaulting scales
which are exaggerated portions of growth-lines. The beaks are smaller
in proportion than in <em class="e000I2">C. magnum</em>. The shell is brown to straw-color,
stained with purplish-brown without, and has a bright salmon-red or
purplish-pink interior. The margins are deeply crenulated. The teeth
are arranged as in the last-described species. It is very common on the
beaches of western Florida. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXIV">Plate LXXXIV.</a>)</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">C. serratum</em>, <em class="eB00I2">C. lævigatum</em>. These two species have a perfectly
smooth surface, and inflated, globose, heart-shaped shells, and are of a
creamy-white color, suffused with a yellowish, golden tint which suggests
the color of butter. Some forms are shiny, and citron-yellow and pinkish

coast to Cape Cod, being very abundant in Long Island Sound. In
the neighborhood of Martha's Vineyard and along
the north shore of Long Island this very pretty
little species has been reported as occurring in soft
ground even above low-tide mark, near the mouths

distinguished by a purple blotch on the posterior
margin, just within the valves, the general color
within being bright yellow. In young specimens,
zigzag lines of dark fawn-color upon the pale-yellowish

along the New England coast. The former has a shell which varies
from one half of an inch to two inches in length, and has
from thirty-six to thirty-eight sharp, three-sided, radiating
ribs, the furrows between them being rounded and wrinkled by
growth-lines. A yellowish-brown epidermis covers the shell and
bristles into a sort of fringe upon the sharp edges of the ribs.
<em class="e000I2">C. islandicum</em> cannot be said to be a
very common species in New England, although collectors have so
reported it. Specimens from Massachusetts are not as large as those
of more northern habitat. It does not occur south of Cape Cod.
<em class="e000I2">C. pinnulatum</em> is one of the "small fry"
among the cockles. Its largest diameter is less than one half of
an inch; but what it lacks in size it seems to endeavor to make
up in abundance, for it is scattered everywhere along the coast
from New York northward. Specimens can nearly always be found
in the stomachs of fishes, which, by the way, form an excellent
hunting-ground for rare species of mollusks of small size. There
are twenty-six slightly rounded ribs, with deep linear grooves
between them. Upon the ribs, especially in the posterior portion
of the shell, are arched scales, folded so as to appear like blunt
spines. The species may easily be distinguished from the young of
<em class="e000I2">C. islandicum</em> by the smaller number of
ribs. The animal, <em class="e000I2">C. pinnulatum</em>, is said
to be exceedingly lively and able to make rapid progress over

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Mya</em></p>

<p>In this family we encounter, rather suddenly, some new features
not heretofore seen in the pelecypod structure. In the
first place, the siphons are enormously large, are united, and are
surrounded by a leathery epidermis. The mantle-edges are fused
together along the entire ventral margin, except for a small slit
through which the foot may project. Although the animal may
withdraw the long siphons into its shell, yet they remain to a
certain extent exposed, for the valves gape widely posteriorly,
and only slightly less so anteriorly. In the economy of these
forms the shell seems to play a less important part than it does
in the <em class="e000I2">Veneridæ</em>, in the <em class="e000I2">Tellinidæ</em>, and generally in those families
whose shells are strong and, closing firmly, afford the animal
within a real protection. The shell of <em class="e000I2">Mya</em> (the principal genus)
is thin, white, and of a softer chalky texture; it gapes widely
"fore and aft," and has a loosely constructed hinge apparatus,
consisting of an erect projecting tooth, which fits into a pit in
the opposite valve.</p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">M. arenaria.</em> This is the common
"soft-shell clam" of New England. Its range is from Cape Cod to
Greenland and Great Britain. Upon the Maine coast it is very
extensively gathered and sold to the Banks fishermen for bait.
Its use as food for man is probably not very great, yet it is
always to be seen on sale in the markets of New England coast
towns. It cannot compare in flavor with <em class="e000I2">Venus
mercenaria</em>, the "hard-shell clam" south of Cape Cod. <em
class="e000I2">M. arenaria</em> lives between tides in muddy,
sandy, pebbly, or even rocky ground, where it can find material
in which it can burrow and hide itself. It lies just below the
surface, with its siphons projected into the water. When the
water recedes, <em class="e000I2">Mya</em> draws in its siphons
and awaits the return of the tide, every now and then <a
id="pg457"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg457]</span> ejecting a jet
of water into the air. The shells vary considerably in size and
thickness of valves. Large specimens are three and a half inches
long and two inches high. Our forefathers were not always well
posted upon the habits of mollusks, even though they may have
relished them in chowders and believed their flesh to possess
valuable curative properties. John Winthrop, in 1634, gave a
list of useful American animals, in which he remarked: "Clam,
white; their broth is most excellent in all intermitting fevers,
consumption, etc. These clams feed only on sand." What marvelous
digestive powers!</p></div>

<h6><em class="e00S02">Family</em> <em class="eBU003">SOLENIDÆ</em></h6>

<p>In this family are included the long, slender bivalves commonly
known as "razor-shells." Every one who has been to the sea-shore
has become familiar with these odd-looking mollusks, for their
valves are always to be found upon every beach. Their station is
upon sandy flats or bars more or less exposed at low tide. They
burrow into the sand perpendicularly to a depth of two or three
feet, remaining hidden most of the time. Occasionally a colony of
them will be seen, each one projecting slightly from his burrow. If
approached most cautiously some of them may be captured, but if the
sand is jarred they all take fright and disappear in an instant.
It is no easy matter to capture a "razor" when once he has taken
warning, for he will dig down into the sand about as fast as one
can follow with a spade. A good way to catch one is to approach
his burrow carefully, and then plunge a spade obliquely down below
him, thereby <a id="pg458"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg458]</span>
cutting off his retreat. So tenaciously will they cling to the
sand by expanding the muscular foot that the shell may be pulled
entirely off the body before they will let go.</p>

<p><em class="eB00I2">E. directus</em> (<em class="eB00I2">Solen
ensis</em>, <em class="eB00I2">Ensis americanus</em>). The common
species upon the New England and Jersey coasts. The foot is long,
and protrudes from one end of the long shell; it is also very
strong, and capable of change at will into almost any form, from a
pointed bulb to a flat disk. The siphons, which project from the
opposite end of the shell, are short and are not united. The gills
are long. The juxtaposition of these organs is at first confusing,
because the greatly elongated form of the shell and the habits of
the animal in burrowing vertically into the sand have caused the
foot to be pushed farther away from the posterior portion of the
shell and to protrude in a direction just opposite to the siphons.
The shells are bent or slightly curved; they gape at both ends; and
they are fitted with very small interlocking teeth at the upper
corner of the posterior end. The color is white, but a yellowish or
greenish glossy epidermis covers the entire test. Length about six
inches. The manner in which the animal makes its rapid descent into
the sand is very interesting. First extending the foot lengthwise
into a point, it plunges it into the sand; then, by forcing water
into the organ it expands it, thus pushing away the sand on all
sides; and still further expanding the foot at the end into a disk,
it secures an anchorage which enables it to draw down its shell. By
quick repetition of this process <em class="e000I2">Ensis</em> can
get out of sight in a remarkably sudden manner.</p></div>

<p><em class="eB00I2">T. gibbus.</em> The extended range and shore station of this exceedingly
abundant species will cause it to be among the first accessions to the
cabinet of the collector south of Cape Cod. It burrows deep in sand
and mud, leaving two small openings to the hole for the accommodation
of its two excessively long siphons. As in <em class="e000I2">Solen</em> and <em class="e000I2">Ensis</em>, the foot is
large and muscular, tongue-shaped, and capable of remarkable change
of form and great freedom of movement. The long white siphons, separated
from the base and each provided with orange-colored eyes (or,
rather, a rudimentary sort of visual organs), are the most important
feature. The apex of the hinge is not, as in <em class="e000I2">Solen</em> and <em class="e000I2">Ensis</em>, at the end
of the shell, but is more conventionally placed near the middle; the
cardinal teeth are very small, two upon each valve and interlocking;
a flat, oblong, callous process serves as a fossette. The dorsal and
ventral margins are parallel, and
gape at both ends; the shell is white,
and is covered with a dense yellowish
epidermis, which, passing the
ventral margin, appears to become
continuous with the thickened mantle-edge.
There is no other species
north of Hatteras with which this
could be confounded. The double entrance to the burrow, which may
be discovered about low-tide mark, is unique. <em class="e000I2">T. gibbus</em> is a good species

<p>In <em class="e000I2">Pholas</em> the anterior part of the
hinge-margin is reflected back over the umbones, and a long
rib-like tooth springs from under the umbonal region and curves
out almost to the center of the valves. The shell gapes "fore
and aft," and is thin, white, very hard, and brittle. The animal
has a short, truncated foot and a small orifice in the mantle
through which the foot may be projected. The siphons are long and
are united almost to their ends. Dorsally, an exposed portion
of the animal is protected by accessory calcareous plates. The
habits of <em class="e000I2">Pholas</em> are very interesting. It
is found in holes gouged out of solid rock or out of pieces of
wood; sometimes, like <em class="e000I2">Petricola</em>, it may
be found excavating in hard clay. As the anterior end of a <em
class="e000I2">Pholas</em> shell is the larger in diameter, and is
the end which is most deeply buried in the rock (the opening of
the burrow being comparatively small), there was some mystery as
to the way in which the creature manages to get inside its rocky
dwelling. Observations in aquaria have shown that the young <em
class="e000I2">Pholas</em> begins his process of home-building
very early in life. The wearing away of the stone is effected by
constantly turning the shell around, scraping with the anterior
edges of the valves. A lodging-place having been secured, <em
class="e000I2">Pholas</em> is obliged to work constantly to
enlarge his burrow for the accommodation of his growing shell.
The long siphons may project from the hole and draw in food
and breath, but the animal is a prisoner for life. When <em
class="e000I2">Pholas</em> has withdrawn his long siphons he is
reasonably secure from his enemies, but <a id="pg461"></a><span
class="xxpgno">[pg461]</span> nevertheless thousands of them are
destroyed by predatory starfishes, who know how to get at their
victims. The restless crustaceans, ever on the outlook for a meal,
often nip the siphons of the rock-dwellers, and a kind of worm
sometimes attacks them, and, destroying the animal, proceeds to
occupy the empty shell and burrow.</p>

is secreted a continuous shelly tube which lines the burrow.
This mollusk, commonly called the "ship-worm," is exceedingly
destructive, perforating with its burrows submerged timber and soon
rendering it useless. Various means are taken to protect ships,
the piles of wharves, buoys, and the like, against its ravages;
copper sheathing, large-headed nails driven close together into
the wood, verdigris paint, and so on, being used with more or less
effect. Vast numbers of these animals enter the wood and burrow in
various directions, but they never interfere with one another, a
thin partition of wood always being left between adjacent burrows.
How they effect the burrowing is not determined, but it is supposed
to be by means of the pallets. <em class="e000I2">Teredo</em>

<p><em class="eB00I2">P. trilineata.</em> A little New England shell, remarkable on account
of its extreme flatness. When looking at this shell before opening it,
one naturally wonders where the animal
finds room to exist between two such
disk-like valves. The animal is very
thin, with largely united mantle-edges,
widely separated feeble adductor muscles,
and a fairly large tongue-shaped
foot. The shell is nacreous, rounded
anteriorly, and produced posteriorly
into a sort of upturned tip which gapes
to accommodate two little siphons. The dorsal hinge-margin is excavated
and curved. Length about one inch. It is abundant at Cape Cod, in
sandy stations, on oyster-beds, and is found from Maine to Florida. <a id="pg464"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg464]</span></p></div>

<h4 title="Class Cephalopoda">CLASS <em class="eBU001">CEPHALOPODA</em></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The <em class="e000I2">Cephalopoda</em> form a singularly isolated group, and are so
superior in organization and intelligence to all other mollusks
that it is difficult to believe that they are first cousins to the
lethargic gasteropod and the simply constructed bivalve. But
the class bears the stamp of its origin in a mantle, a radula, and
a disposition of internal organs and functions which, although
highly perfected, is essentially molluscan.</p>

<p>Along the Atlantic coast of the United States, particularly in
its northern portion, occur several examples of cephalopods belonging
to the genera <em class="e000I2">Ommastrephes</em> and <em class="e000I2">Loligo</em>, all the species of
which are referred to, in common parlance, as "squids." They
frequent shallow water, and are often to be found in weirs, darting
about with rapid, spasmodic movements, or perhaps lying
motionless on the bottom. The squids enter the weirs for the
purpose of capturing the young mackerel which are caught in
these traps. The squid lies quietly upon the bottom, which it
simulates so closely in color as to be almost invisible, and when <a id="pg465"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg465]</span>
a school of fishes swims over it, darts suddenly into the midst of
it, seizes a fish with its sucker-bearing arms, and kills it by the
bite of its parrot-like beak or jaws. Sometimes it happens that
squids, while pursuing fish too near shore, precipitate themselves
upon the beach, where they flounder about, ejecting water from
their siphons, which pushes them only farther away from the
water, and squirting out "ink" from their ink-sacs in a vain endeavor
to hide themselves from view. On bright moonlight
nights squids often go ashore in vast numbers, and perish within
a few inches of their native element, which they seem to be unable
to regain. These creatures usually swim backward, and the theory
is that, dazzled by the bright light of the moon, they continue to
gaze at it while swimming, and if there happens to be a shore in
the direction of their movements, they suddenly find themselves
beached. The fishermen of Canada and New England take advantage
of this habit and capture great quantities of squids by placing
bright lights in the bows of their boats and then rowing toward
shore, thus driving the squids out of the water. The Banks
fishermen use them as bait for catching cod. The right claimed by
American fishing-schooners to purchase squids in Newfoundland
has helped to keep alive the quarrel between Canadian and
American fishermen, which has vexed their respective governments
for many years.</p>

<p>The range in size among the species of this class is very remarkable.
The little sepiolas are about an inch long; the squids
of our coasts vary in length from eight inches to one foot; and
the giant <em class="e000I2">Architeuthis</em> of the North Atlantic measures, often,
fifty feet from the end of its arms to the tip of its tail. Such
a creature, with its long arms provided with suckers, its powerful
jaws, and its rapid, alert movements, is a formidable foe.
These animals have been the basis of many legends about
sea-serpents and sea-monsters. A gruesome story of an
octopus is told by Victor Hugo in "The Toilers of the Sea,"
where he gives a thrilling account of a man's encounter with
a devil-fish in a cave. One who has read this tale has a vivid
picture in his mind of the giant squid, and the danger of
meeting one of these many-armed foes. Victor Hugo's devil-fish, <a id="pg466"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg466]</span>
however, is an animal not true to nature, but a composite,
having the attributes of the polyp and of the octopus, and the
name of a large ray of Southern waters, a real fish, the <em class="e000I2">Cephaloptera</em>,
known in its localities as devil-fish. This monstrosity of the
novelist's imagination has, however, done more to acquaint the
general public with these interesting cephalopods than have the
descriptions of scientists.</p>

<p>The giant squid, which is such a dangerous foe, has its own
enemy in the sperm-whale. The cachalot swims through the
water with its lower jaw hanging, the cephalopod grasps the jaw,
and the whale then shuts his capacious mouth upon it. Whalemen
describe conflicts between these enormous creatures, the
whale always being the conqueror. Sperm-whales killed by man
often eject great quantities of the squids in their death throes,
showing this food to be almost their exclusive diet.</p>

<p>The name "cephalopod," meaning "feet around the head," is
descriptive in part of their anatomy. The head is usually
marked off by a neck-constriction, and it bears two highly
organized eyes. The foot is fused in part with the head above
the eyes and around the mouth; on the upper side it is divided
into eight or ten long arm-like processes, bearing suckers, which
act as organs of prehension. The under part of the foot forms a
tube called the funnel. Through the funnel the animal expels
water from the mantle cavity, and thus propels itself through
the water.</p>

<p>The mantle covers the body of the animal, and is a cup-shaped
or conical envelope, open only at the anterior end, through which
project the head and siphon or funnel. It is attached to the
body by a line on the dorsal side, the anterior margin being free
and open, but provided with an arrangement of cartilages by
which it can be hooked on to the siphon, thus completely closing
the entrance to the mantle cavity. The mantle is very muscular,
and is constantly expanding and contracting, taking water into
the mantle cavity through the mantle opening for respiratory
purposes, or expelling it through the siphon for propulsion; in
the latter case the mantle opening is closed at the moment of
ejecting the water. When the siphon is in its normal position <a id="pg467"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg467]</span>
the animal swims backward; but it can be turned back over the
edge of the mantle, giving a forward movement.</p>

<p>The surface of the mantle is covered with pigment-cells (<em class="e000I2">chromatophores</em>).
There are sets of chromatophores containing different
colors. The cells are opened or closed at will by muscular
action of their walls. When open the cells seem to fuse together,
giving a solid color-surface, or spots of color as desired, in blue,
red, yellow, or brown; when closed they seem as specks on the
almost transparent tissues of the animal. Flashes of changing
color follow one another with great rapidity over the living animal.
In swimming it assumes the color of its surroundings.</p>

<p>Another curious means of protection possessed by the dibranchiate
cephalopods is an ink-bag, the brown or black secretions
of which are ejected through the siphon, clouding the water when
the animal wishes to escape from danger. The ink taken from
the ink-sac of <em class="e000I2">Sepia</em> is an article of commerce.</p>

<p>Only <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em> and the female <em class="e000I2">Argonauta</em> have the characteristic
external shell of mollusks. In all other forms the shell is internal
or is invested in the integument of the mantle. Of such is the
cuttlebone of commerce, which is a calcareous leaf-like body
obtained from <em class="e000I2">Sepia</em>, the cuttlefish. The common squid <em class="e000I2">Loligo</em>
has a horny substance situated in the dorsal side of the mantle,
called the pen. <em class="e000I2">Spirula</em> has a spiral internal shell divided into
chambers. Vast numbers of these shells are cast upon the
beaches of the Pacific Islands, and they have also been found on
the shore of Nantucket.</p>

<p>Cephalopods are separated into two subclasses. In the first, the
<em class="e000I2">Tetrabranchiata</em>, there are four branchiæ, four nephridia, and four
auricles. They are without an ink-sac, and have the foot divided
into lobes bearing sheathed tentacles. <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em> is the only genus.</p>

<h5>SUBCLASS <em class="eBU001">TETRABRANCHIATA</em></h5>

<p class="genushead"><em class="e00S02">Genus</em> <em class="eB00I2">Nautilus</em></p>

<p>Probably the best-known cephalopod is <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em>—the pearly-shelled,
chambered nautilus made immortal in the beautiful poem
of Oliver Wendell Holmes. The shell of <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em> is a flat spiral;
the interior is divided by septa forming a series of chambers; <a id="pg468"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg468]</span>
the septa are perforated, and through the opening runs a tube or
prolongation of the body, the siphuncle, which extends to the tip of
the shell. The chambers are filled with gas. The animal in the
course of its growth moves forward into a newly formed chamber
and builds a new septum, closing the cavity last occupied. <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em>
lives among the coral reefs of the southern Pacific. Its
four or five species are the remnants of a once very extensive race
of cephalopods. The fossil remains of many species of <em class="e000I2">Nautilus</em>,
together with various other genera of shell-bearing cephalopods,
indicate that this group has seen its best days. The dibranchiate
genera, however, appear to have reached their maximum at the
present day.</p>

</div>

<p>The second subclass, the <em class="e000I2">Dibranchiata</em>,
is characterized by two branchiæ and two auricles. The main part
of the foot is divided into eight or ten long arms provided
with numerous suckers arranged in from one to four rows on
the ventral side of the arms. They have also an ink-sac. The
<em class="e000I2">Dibranchiata</em> are divided into two
orders: the <em class="e000I2">Octopoda</em>, which have
eight arms, and comprise the <em class="e000I2">Octopus</em>
and <em class="e000I2">Argonauta</em>; and the <em
class="e000I2">Decapoda</em>, which have ten arms, and comprise <em
class="e000I2">Spirula</em>, <em class="e000I2">Ommastrephes</em>,
<em class="e000I2">Sepia</em>, and <em class="e000I2">Loligo</em>.
In these animals two of the ten arms are longer than the others,
and these tentacular arms have suckers only on their broadened,
club-like ends, they are kept retracted within grooves, one on
each side of the head, except when needed for prehension. <a

the body, united in a point posteriorly, and obtusely rounded on
the outer angles. The head is a little narrower than the mantle.
There are eight sessile, sub-triangular arms furnished with two
series of suckers which are hemispherical and stalked, and two long
retractile tentacular arms dilated at the extremities, bearing four
rows of suckers. It has a pen-&#160;or quill-shaped cartilaginous

<em class="e000I2">L. Pealei</em>, but with shorter fins. These
are broad and pear-shaped, one third wider than they are long, and
usually reach less than one half the length of the mantle. They are
straight on the posterior end, and form nearly a right angle, while
the upper margins are rounded. The head is as broad as the mantle.
The arms are stout and taper to an acute point. The tentacular arms
are long when expanded. The species is abundant from Cape Cod to
Newfoundland, and is found as far south as Newport, Rhode Island.
This is the squid which is used so extensively in the Banks fishery
as bait. It <a id="pg470"></a><span class="xxpgno">[pg470]</span>
visits the shores in large schools, presumably in pursuit of prey,
and often itself becomes the victim. It is a beautiful creature
from its varying colors, which are truly wonderful. It changes in
a moment from vivid red to deep blue, purple, orange, and so on,
the colors often passing over it in flashes as it swims along. <a

 <a id="pg474"></a>CHORDATA<br />CLASS <em class="eBU001">UROCHORDA</em>
 or <em class="eBU001">TUNICATA</em></h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>The most conspicuous animals of this class are the ascidians,
which are common objects on rocky coasts. The <em class="e000I2">simple
ascidians</em> are peculiar leathery, sac-shaped bodies which send out
jets of water when touched. This habit gives them the common
name of "sea-squirts." Some are highly colored, especially
those of Southern waters; others are somber, unattractive bodies,
often growing in masses. The <em class="e000I2">compound ascidians</em> are gelatinous
colonies, sometimes forming thin incrustations, sometimes jelly-like
masses, on seaweeds, shells, etc. This class comprises also
the beautiful <em class="e000I2">Salpa</em>, a genus of free-swimming animals having
transparent bodies encircled by rings of muscular bands, and in
one stage forming chains of attached organisms which swim on
the surface of the sea and of bays.</p>

<p>The tunicates are by some authors classed with the vertebrate
animals because in the larval stage they have a notochord; this
disappears, however, in the adult form, and the animals are
considered degenerates. The tunicates are interesting to biologists
from the remarkable changes they undergo in their life-history, and
(in some genera) the marked phase of alternation of generation. One
of their curious anatomical features is the blood-vascular system.
The circulation is propelled by wave-like contractions of the
heart, which, after forcing the blood one way for a time, stops and
reverses the blood-current. The tunicates are widely distributed,
and occur at all depths. (<a href="#Plate-LXXXV">Plate LXXXV.</a>) <a id="pg475"></a><span

 <div class="caption"><em class="e000I2">Salpa</em> chain.</div>
</div>

<p>The animals of this genus are transparent, subcylindrical,
smooth, gelatinous bodies encircled by bands of white muscular
fiber. They strikingly exemplify alternation of generations. They
occur in two distinct conditions, one being solitary, the other
consisting of animals united in chains. The solitary individuals
are about an inch long, and have two long processes at the
posterior end. These single animals reproduce by budding, and
form series of individuals in small chains, the animals being
arranged in two rows. The chains grow to the length of a foot or
more, and contain twenty to thirty pairs of salpas. Each of these
connected individuals produces in turn a single egg, which becomes
a single <em class="e000I2">Salpa</em>, and this again, like its
grandmother, reproduces by budding. Thus the animals are alike only
in alternate generations. The naturalist Chamisso, who discovered
the relationship between the two forms, expressed it as follows:
a <em class="e000I2">Salpa</em> mother is not like its daughter
or its mother, but resembles its sister, its grandmother, and its
granddaughter. The single zoöids liberate many colonies during
the summer, which grow rapidly, and in the autumn the chains are
exceedingly abundant. The <em class="e000I2">Salpa</em> chains
swim about with a serpentine movement, and are beautiful, delicate
objects with their transparent bodies banded with white, tinged
with pink, and streaked with blue.</p>

<h4 title="Compound Ascidians">COMPOUND ASCIDIANS</h4>

<div class="rtntoc"><a href="#contents">toc</a></div>

<p>Ascidians of this group form fixed colonies, and are embedded
in gelatinous material, the animals having a common test, but not
being united by any internal union. The colonies thus formed
are flat and incrusting, or are branched and lobed, or sometimes
elevated on stalks. The zoöids are in some cases dotted irregularly
over the entire surface, in others are in rows, or again are
in groups. They have various colors—purple, yellow, blue, gray,
and green. They are common on eel-grass, the piles of wharves,
the bottoms of boats, and so on.</p>

<em class="eB00I2">Botryllus</em></p>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">B. gouldii.</em> This species forms thick,
fleshy, translucent incrustations, often several inches in length
and a quarter of an inch wide, over eel-grass, the piles of
wharves, and other objects. Sometimes, at the end of summer, small
objects are completely covered with the luxuriant growth of this
compound ascidian. The zoöids form circular or elliptical groups,
often as many as fifteen surrounding each orifice, looking like
minute stars. The colonies vary in color. Often on the same stem of
eel-grass will be found separate colonies varying in this respect.
In some the ground-color will be olive-green specked with white,
while the zoöids are purple, marked with other colors; again the
arrangement is quite different.</p></div>

<div class="species">

<p><em class="eB00I2">A. pellucidum.</em> A massive compound
ascidian, smooth, translucent, and gelatinous, which forms large,
hemispherical, complex, irregular masses six inches or more in
diameter. It is usually covered by adhering sand. The mass consists
of club-shaped lobes, which rise from a common base. Each lobe
contains a central orifice around which long, slender zoöids,
sometimes an inch long, are grouped. These masses are so abundant
in some places that they cover the bottom for considerable spaces.
They are found in deep water from Cape Cod to North Carolina. <a

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTE</div>

<p>The original text has been retained as printed, with
some exceptions. Illustrations have been moved from within
paragraphs to nearby spots between paragraphs. Page numbers
from the printed 1901 edition are indicated like this: "<span
class="xxpgno">[pg235]</span>".</p>

<p>Many of the biological classification schemes shown in this book
were printed with large curly brackets "{" extending several lines
high. For example, on page <a href="#pg018">18</a>, a classification scheme was printed
similar to this:</p>

<table summary="example page 18">
<tr>
  <td class="center"><em class="e000I2">Rhodymeniaceæ</em>,</td>
  <td>{<em class="e000I2">Callithamnion</em></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td class="center">suborder</td>
  <td>{<em class="e000I2">Griffithsia</em></td></tr>
<tr>
  <td class="center"><em class="e000I2">Ceramieæ</em></td>
  <td>{<em class="e000I2">Ceramium</em></td></tr>
</table>

<p class="continue">except that the three "{" were not printed,
but were replaced by a single tall "{". This typography does not
generally work well in current electronic books. Therefore, tables
or schemes of this sort have (except on page 18) been replaced
by a different format (nested list) employing rearrangement and
indentation, without curly brackets—like this:</p>

<div class="taxa" style="page-break-before:avoid;">
<ul><li>Order <em class="e000I2">Rhodymeniaceæ</em>
 <ul><li>Suborder <em class="e000I2">Ceramieæ</em>
  <ul><li>Genus <em class="e000I2">Callithamnion</em></li>
    <li>Genus <em class="e000I2">Griffithsia</em></li>
    <li>Genus <em class="e000I2">Ceramium</em></li></ul></li></ul></li>
</ul></div>

<p class="continue">There are rare instances when this could cause
confusion. For example, the partial paragraph that preceeds the page
18 example being discussed:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The genera of an order are then placed within a cover and
labeled in the same way, the legend then having the name of the
order on the left and the genera on the right of the bracket,
thus:</p></div>

<p class="continue">refers to a bracket no longer present in the
electronic version, and "left" and "right" are perhaps no longer
meaningful. Also, the captions heading most of these taxonomies
use the word "table", which is retained, although it is now
wrong, and should be interpreted as "taxonomy" or "list". <a
href="#Footnote_TN">Return to footnote †.</a></p>

<p>As mentioned on page <a href="#pg029">29</a> of the book,
typography was used in a specific way to visually distinguish
various taxonomic classes. Some of the forms used herein do not
work well in some current e-reader applications. For example,
small-caps do not currently work well in many epub reader
applications. Therefore, small-caps typography is herein reinforced
with an underline. Here are examples of most of the variants:
<em class="eBU003">BOLD UPPERCASE SMALL</em>;
<em class="eBU001">BOLD UPPERCASE LARGE</em>;
<em class="eB00I2">Bold Italic</em>;
<em class="eB0002">Bold</em>;
<em class="e0U003">UPPERCASE SMALL</em>;
<em class="e00S02">Small Caps</em>; and
<em class="e000I2">Italic</em>.</p>

<p><a href="#pg102">Page 102</a>: "flagellœte Infusoria" was changed to "flagellate
Infusoria" to match the corresponding index entry.</p>

<p><a href="#pg116">Page 116</a>, Table showing the classification of Hydrozoa: genera
and species were printed in one table column without distinction.
These have been recast into the usual style used in this electronic
edition. Also, for the purpose of this recasting, it has been assumed
that a taxonomic "Division" can be taken to be an informal subset of
a "Family", at least in this specific taxonomy.</p>

<p><a href="#pg150">Page 150</a>: in "The strictures forming the lobes", changed "strictures"
to "structures".</p>

<p><a href="#pg154">Page 154</a>: changed "rhododaciyla" to "rhododactyla".</p>

<p><a href="#pg172">Page 172</a>: changed "perisaltic" to "peristaltic".</p>

<p><a href="#pg188">Page 188</a>: in the table showing the classification of the Mulluscoida,
there are grouping words such as "Articulata", "Inarticulata", and
"Flustrina", which are not labeled as to whether they are taxonomic
"Family", or some other class. The transcriber has chosen to label
them "Set", which term is not elsewhere used in the book to denote a
formal taxonomic class. The same sort of thing is done on a few other
pages, e.g. on page <a href="#pg240">240</a>, for the group "Free-swimming Forms", part
of Suborder Macrura.</p>

<p><a href="#pg196">Page 196</a>: "Phyllopora" changed to "Phyllophora"—a guess.</p>
